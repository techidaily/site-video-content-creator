<p>This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out.

<h2 id="After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere"><a href="#After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="After Effects VS Adobe Premiere"></a>After Effects VS Adobe Premiere</h2><h4 id="1Timeline"><a href="#1Timeline" class="headerlink" title="1Timeline"></a>1Timeline</h4><p>There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.</p>
<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2Editing"><a href="#2Editing" class="headerlink" title="2Editing"></a>2Editing</h4><p>In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3Audio-Mixer"><a href="#3Audio-Mixer" class="headerlink" title="3Audio Mixer"></a>3Audio Mixer</h4><p>In today’s market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn’t be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4Mercury-Playback-Engine"><a href="#4Mercury-Playback-Engine" class="headerlink" title="4Mercury Playback Engine"></a>4Mercury Playback Engine</h4><p>In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-4.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Multicam"><a href="#5-Multicam" class="headerlink" title="5 Multicam"></a>5 Multicam</h4><p>In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn’t comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-5.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="6Media-Management"><a href="#6Media-Management" class="headerlink" title="6Media Management"></a>6Media Management</h4><p>Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-6.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="7Masking"><a href="#7Masking" class="headerlink" title="7Masking"></a>7Masking</h4><p>This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-7.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="8-Camera-Tracker"><a href="#8-Camera-Tracker" class="headerlink" title="8 Camera Tracker"></a>8 Camera Tracker</h4><p>The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-8.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="9-Effects"><a href="#9-Effects" class="headerlink" title="9 Effects"></a>9 Effects</h4><p>The collection of specific tools within After Effects for applying motion control effects, for color control, blurring shadows transitions and titles is vast, and whilst Premiere includes some of its own, it is clear that here After Effects has the edge and it once again highlights the different approach taken by each program. Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.</p>
<p>After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-9.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I’ve seen it explained before in terms of Word and Excel. You can compose a letter in Excel and create a spreadsheet in Word with the tables functionality, but the end result will take much longer and never be quite as good doing it that way. This perhaps is the best way to explain the relationship between Premiere and After Effects.</p>
<p>Yes, a spec sheet makes the two programs seem somewhat comparable, but it is the focus of each application that shows why they differ so much. Ultimately, the best use of these programs is together, they complement each other perfectly.</p>

<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>

<h2 id="After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere-3"><a href="#After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere-3" class="headerlink" title="After Effects VS Adobe Premiere"></a>After Effects VS Adobe Premiere</h2><h4 id="1Timeline-3"><a href="#1Timeline-3" class="headerlink" title="1Timeline"></a>1Timeline</h4><p>There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.</p>
<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2Editing-3"><a href="#2Editing-3" class="headerlink" title="2Editing"></a>2Editing</h4><p>In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3Audio-Mixer-3"><a href="#3Audio-Mixer-3" class="headerlink" title="3Audio Mixer"></a>3Audio Mixer</h4><p>In today’s market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn’t be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4Mercury-Playback-Engine-3"><a href="#4Mercury-Playback-Engine-3" class="headerlink" title="4Mercury Playback Engine"></a>4Mercury Playback Engine</h4><p>In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-4.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Multicam-3"><a href="#5-Multicam-3" class="headerlink" title="5 Multicam"></a>5 Multicam</h4><p>In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn’t comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-5.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="6Media-Management-3"><a href="#6Media-Management-3" class="headerlink" title="6Media Management"></a>6Media Management</h4><p>Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-6.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="7Masking-3"><a href="#7Masking-3" class="headerlink" title="7Masking"></a>7Masking</h4><p>This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-7.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="8-Camera-Tracker-3"><a href="#8-Camera-Tracker-3" class="headerlink" title="8 Camera Tracker"></a>8 Camera Tracker</h4><p>The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-8.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="9-Effects-3"><a href="#9-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="9 Effects"></a>9 Effects</h4><p>The collection of specific tools within After Effects for applying motion control effects, for color control, blurring shadows transitions and titles is vast, and whilst Premiere includes some of its own, it is clear that here After Effects has the edge and it once again highlights the different approach taken by each program. Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.</p>
<p>After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-9.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I’ve seen it explained before in terms of Word and Excel. You can compose a letter in Excel and create a spreadsheet in Word with the tables functionality, but the end result will take much longer and never be quite as good doing it that way. This perhaps is the best way to explain the relationship between Premiere and After Effects.</p>
<p>Yes, a spec sheet makes the two programs seem somewhat comparable, but it is the focus of each application that shows why they differ so much. Ultimately, the best use of these programs is together, they complement each other perfectly.</p>

<p>Cropping a video, to bring focus onto the important aspects and remove the extraneous parts of the scene, is one of the most valuable tools available to a video editor. It can be used as mentioned to ensure the viewer focuses on what is important, but also to magnify objects on the screen, such as with footage of nature. It has many uses, and one of the best tools available for cropping video is the free program Avidemux. Here we are going to go through the process of getting Avidemux running on your system and cropping some video.</p>
<hr>
<p>If Avidemux is too complicate for you, you can consider <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is an easy-to-use video editing tool to crop videos within several click.

Installation"></a>1. Installation</h4><p>You can find <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/" >Avidemux for download here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it is available for a wide range of platforms, just download the version that fits your needs. Once downloaded, install in the standard way for your platform, this is the Wndows version (64bit).</p>
<p>One point of note during installation is that you can choose which parts of the program you wish to install. It is a very small footprint and for the best performance it is wise to simply install everything.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation2.png"
                      alt="Installation2"
                ></p>
<p>Once installed you will be presented with the program as seen here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation3.png"
                      alt="Installation3"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Importing-Video"><a href="#2-Importing-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. Importing Video"></a>2. Importing Video</h4><p>The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video1.png"
                      alt="Importing Video1"
                ></p>
<p>Whichever route you take, you will end up with your video file loaded in like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video2.png"
                      alt="Importing Video2"
                ></p>
<p>Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.</p>
<h4 id="3-Editing-Video"><a href="#3-Editing-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Editing Video"></a>3. Editing Video</h4><p>Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/editing-video.png"
                      alt="Editing Video"
                ></p>
<p>Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.</p>
<h4 id="4-Cropping"><a href="#4-Cropping" class="headerlink" title="4. Cropping"></a>4. Cropping</h4><p>It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video&gt;Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png"
                      alt="Cropping1"
                ></p>
<p>Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping2.png"
                      alt="Cropping2"
                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Cropping-controls"><a href="#5-Cropping-controls" class="headerlink" title="5. Cropping controls"></a>5. Cropping controls</h4><p>There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png"
                      alt="Cropping controls1"
                ></p>
<p>You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png"
                      alt="Cropping controls2"
                ></p>
<p>Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.</p>
<h4 id="6-Saving-the-crop"><a href="#6-Saving-the-crop" class="headerlink" title="6. Saving the crop"></a>6. Saving the crop</h4><p>One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file&gt;save menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png"
                      alt="Saving the crop1"
                ></p>
<p>Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png"
                      alt="Saving the crop2"
                ></p>
<p>How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.</p>
<p>As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.</p>
<p>One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.</p>
<p>Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want.

<p>Cropping a video, to bring focus onto the important aspects and remove the extraneous parts of the scene, is one of the most valuable tools available to a video editor. It can be used as mentioned to ensure the viewer focuses on what is important, but also to magnify objects on the screen, such as with footage of nature. It has many uses, and one of the best tools available for cropping video is the free program Avidemux. Here we are going to go through the process of getting Avidemux running on your system and cropping some video.</p>

<p>If Avidemux is too complicate for you, you can consider <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is an easy-to-use video editing tool to crop videos within several click.

Installation"></a>1. Installation</h4><p>You can find <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/" >Avidemux for download here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it is available for a wide range of platforms, just download the version that fits your needs. Once downloaded, install in the standard way for your platform, this is the Wndows version (64bit).</p>
<p>One point of note during installation is that you can choose which parts of the program you wish to install. It is a very small footprint and for the best performance it is wise to simply install everything.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation2.png"
                      alt="Installation2"
                ></p>
<p>Once installed you will be presented with the program as seen here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/installation3.png"
                      alt="Installation3"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Importing-Video-1"><a href="#2-Importing-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Importing Video"></a>2. Importing Video</h4><p>The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video1.png"
                      alt="Importing Video1"
                ></p>
<p>Whichever route you take, you will end up with your video file loaded in like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/importing-video2.png"
                      alt="Importing Video2"
                ></p>
<p>Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.</p>
<h4 id="3-Editing-Video-1"><a href="#3-Editing-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Editing Video"></a>3. Editing Video</h4><p>Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/editing-video.png"
                      alt="Editing Video"
                ></p>
<p>Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.</p>
<h4 id="4-Cropping-1"><a href="#4-Cropping-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Cropping"></a>4. Cropping</h4><p>It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video&gt;Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png"
                      alt="Cropping1"
                ></p>
<p>Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping2.png"
                      alt="Cropping2"
                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Cropping-controls-1"><a href="#5-Cropping-controls-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Cropping controls"></a>5. Cropping controls</h4><p>There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png"
                      alt="Cropping controls1"
                ></p>
<p>You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls2.png"
                      alt="Cropping controls2"
                ></p>
<p>Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.</p>
<h4 id="6-Saving-the-crop-1"><a href="#6-Saving-the-crop-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Saving the crop"></a>6. Saving the crop</h4><p>One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file&gt;save menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png"
                      alt="Saving the crop1"
                ></p>
<p>Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png"
                      alt="Saving the crop2"
                ></p>
<p>How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.</p>
<p>As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.</p>
<p>One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.</p>
<p>Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.</p>

<h4 id="2-Importing-Video-2"><a href="#2-Importing-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Importing Video"></a>2. Importing Video</h4><p>The next step is importing video. This can be done in two ways, by clicking the file folder icon at the top left you open a standard file browser to navigate to, and select your chosen video file, or alternatively you can simply drag you video into the main panel to import it.</p>
<p><img

<p>Now you can edit the video as you need, Avidemux contains a wealth of features to enable the full spectrum of editing tasks to be completed. However, here we are going to look at the cropping tool, so on to the next step.</p>
<h4 id="3-Editing-Video-2"><a href="#3-Editing-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Editing Video"></a>3. Editing Video</h4><p>Avidemux has some idiosyncrasies in terms of operation, one of those is that to be able to edit any video, you have to choose your output format. Don’t worry though, this is easy, just use the dropdown at the side to choose the output format you want as can be seen here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Editing Video"
                ></p>
<p>Once that is set you are free to start editing your footage.</p>
<h4 id="4-Cropping-2"><a href="#4-Cropping-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Cropping"></a>4. Cropping</h4><p>It is important to understand how the editing process works in Avidemux, everything is accessed via the filters menu Video&gt;Filters and from here you are faced with a new interface that enables you to choose the component you wish to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping.png"
                      alt="Cropping1"
                ></p>
<p>Selecting ‘Crop’ from the menu and pressing the green plus symbol at the bottom activated the crop tool and presents you with yet another view that allows you to adjust the crop to your tastes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Cropping2"
                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Cropping-controls-2"><a href="#5-Cropping-controls-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Cropping controls"></a>5. Cropping controls</h4><p>There are two options for cropping, you can use the Auto crop feature, which will detect any black lines and crop the footage between them, or if you are using the crop tool for something else, or just want to do it manually, you can set the crop via the left right top and bottom boxes. Values input here are the number of pixels from that edge the crop extends, as you are setting it, this is displayed with a green block signifying the area of the image that will be removed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/cropping-controls1.png"
                      alt="Cropping controls1"
                ></p>
<p>You can adjust this independently for all 4 edges as you wish.</p>

                      alt="Cropping controls2"
                ></p>
<p>Once you are happy with the crop, you click Ok and it takes you back to the familiar filter menu where you can use other components to perform more editing if you need.</p>
<h4 id="6-Saving-the-crop-2"><a href="#6-Saving-the-crop-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Saving the crop"></a>6. Saving the crop</h4><p>One of the most common points of confusion with Avidemux comes at this point, as your video will look no different to when you started, and many think they have done something wrong, but this is another part of Avidemux workflow. These filters can only be applied when the video is reencoded, and you do that through the file&gt;save menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop1.png"
                      alt="Saving the crop1"
                ></p>
<p>Selecting this presents the familiar export dialogue and allows you to choose the name and destination of the file. Once that is done you click OK and you will see Avidemux processing your file and re-rendering it in this dialogue box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/saving-the-crop2.png"
                      alt="Saving the crop2"
                ></p>
<p>How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.</p>
<p>As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.</p>
<p>One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.</p>
<p>Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.</p>

<p>How long it takes will depend on a few factors, how many other effects have been added, how fast a processor your computer has, and how large and what resolution the video is. Format also plays a part in the process too, with some formats taking less time to encode than others. Once it has finished, you can view your video and see the crop in action.</p>
<p>As we can see, although there are a few aspects of the workflow that are a little unintuitive, cropping video in Avidemux is a straightforward process that anyone can accomplish with a bit of patience.</p>
<p>One of the key things to remember with Avidemux is that you apply all of your filters before re-encoding, this again is a question of patience and a bit of organization to ensure everything you wish to do is completed in order.</p>
<p>Avidemux is a great piece of software, it lacks the polish of some of its commercial rivals of course, but behind the sometimes clunky interface there is a very broad range of features that allow you to accomplish more or less any editing task you may want. In terms of free programs this is about as good as it gets, and the output is, without a doubt, great quality. For anyone looking for a free solution to video editing problems, and who do not mind a learning process Avidemux provides a useful tool.</p>

If you have both vital qualities, read on to understand how to maximise the effects in your film.</p>
<h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1. Get your timing right</h3><p>If you want your characters to move quickly, then you need fewer images and movements per second. If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p>
<h3 id="2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural"><a href="#2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural" class="headerlink" title="2. Making your characters’ movements natural"></a>2. Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li>
<li>The toe on this foot then descends</li>
<li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li>
<li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

<p>Brickfilms, the cool name for Lego stop-motion animations, is a raging success on YouTube and other video streaming sites. No longer are you limited to build and play with your Lego sets. You can now use apps to bring a story alive. Drag those bricks down from the attic or pull them out of the kids’ box, as you could have a potential goldmine in your home.</p>

You only need a basic set of Lego bricks and your smartphone or iPad if you want to keep it simple. You could use a desk lamp for lighting or a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to add some professionalism should you wish.</p>
<p>Start by setting up your scene. You need a flat and stable surface. It needs to be at a height where you will be comfortable working for an extended period. If you set it up on your floor, you could regret this when the aches in your knees and back kick in. Keep your set in place by using masking tape, so it doesn’t move if you accidentally bump into it.</p>

<p>I Can Animate is a way to produce movies quickly and with little need for that much tech knowledge. You can use your iOS device, whether tablet or phone, to create and then share your videos. This app is produced by Kudlian Software Ltd and retails on different prices on Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>I Can Animate is unique in its simplicity. You use the camera on your iOS device, and the app will show you the differences between frames, so you can check your progress. This is called onion skinning and is essential to the success of your animation.</p>
<p>There are some basic editing features. These features include an ability to view the images on a timeline and duplicate or reorder these. You can also change the exposure, balance and focus settings to ensure there is a replication of conditions between photographs.</p>

<p>A useful option is the ability to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and capture your images without returning to your device. This means you can secure your phone or tablet and avoid knocking or changing the angle by tapping on the screen. Also helpful for streamlining the filming process is the inbuilt time-lapse feature. You can automatically capture images one after another without having to return to the camera.</p>
<p>You can then share these movies by exporting them to Facebook, YouTube or Dropbox.</p>

<p>Stop Motion Studio, produced by Cateater, is an app offered for people age 4 and over and is available on iOS and Android – for your phone or your tablet. There is also a full-featured movie editing software that you can buy for your PC and Mac.</p>
<p>The app is free to download, with some free features. However, there are in-App purchases for some of the better features. You can purchase the Stop Motion Studio Pro app at the cost of $4.99 for Android devices, which then opens all the advanced features in the app.</p>
<p>The advanced features include a function to add and adjust audio, importing and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >cropping images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as 4K Ultra HD and much more. The Green Screen function is particularly smart, as this allows you to include a background, which is preloaded onto the phone.</p>
<p>Reviews are positive. Most note that the product appears simple to use – and you can get high-quality Lego movies without feeling daunted. However, the intuitive nature of the app design belies the smart tools available for your movie production. You can add in text, speech bubbles and titles. You can add facial expressions to your Lego figures. The eraser tool is wonderful, as you can delete unwanted objects from your images.</p>

If you have both vital qualities, read on to understand how to maximise the effects in your film.</p>
<h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right-1"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1. Get your timing right</h3><p>If you want your characters to move quickly, then you need fewer images and movements per second. If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p>

Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle-1"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li>
<li>The toe on this foot then descends</li>
<li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li>
<li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect-1"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

<p>Brickfilms, the cool name for Lego stop-motion animations, is a raging success on YouTube and other video streaming sites. No longer are you limited to build and play with your Lego sets.

<p>Start by setting up your scene. You need a flat and stable surface. It needs to be at a height where you will be comfortable working for an extended period. If you set it up on your floor, you could regret this when the aches in your knees and back kick in. Keep your set in place by using masking tape, so it doesn’t move if you accidentally bump into it.</p>

                      alt="I Can Animate for iOS Interface "
                ></p>
<p>I Can Animate is a way to produce movies quickly and with little need for that much tech knowledge. You can use your iOS device, whether tablet or phone, to create and then share your videos. This app is produced by Kudlian Software Ltd and retails on different prices on Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>I Can Animate is unique in its simplicity. You use the camera on your iOS device, and the app will show you the differences between frames, so you can check your progress. This is called onion skinning and is essential to the success of your animation.</p>
<p>There are some basic editing features. These features include an ability to view the images on a timeline and duplicate or reorder these. You can also change the exposure, balance and focus settings to ensure there is a replication of conditions between photographs.</p>

                ></p>
<p>A useful option is the ability to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and capture your images without returning to your device. This means you can secure your phone or tablet and avoid knocking or changing the angle by tapping on the screen. Also helpful for streamlining the filming process is the inbuilt time-lapse feature. You can automatically capture images one after another without having to return to the camera.</p>
<p>You can then share these movies by exporting them to Facebook, YouTube or Dropbox.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Stop Motion Studio, produced by Cateater, is an app offered for people age 4 and over and is available on iOS and Android – for your phone or your tablet. There is also a full-featured movie editing software that you can buy for your PC and Mac.</p>
<p>The app is free to download, with some free features. However, there are in-App purchases for some of the better features. You can purchase the Stop Motion Studio Pro app at the cost of $4.99 for Android devices, which then opens all the advanced features in the app.</p>
<p>The advanced features include a function to add and adjust audio, importing and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >cropping images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as 4K Ultra HD and much more. The Green Screen function is particularly smart, as this allows you to include a background, which is preloaded onto the phone.</p>
<p>Reviews are positive. Most note that the product appears simple to use – and you can get high-quality Lego movies without feeling daunted. However, the intuitive nature of the app design belies the smart tools available for your movie production. You can add in text, speech bubbles and titles. You can add facial expressions to your Lego figures. The eraser tool is wonderful, as you can delete unwanted objects from your images.</p>

<p>This branded movie maker is free on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.moviemaker.thelegomovie2" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is suitable for children aged 8 and above, so a little more advanced than the more basic I Can Animate – but it is designed only to be used on your phone, using the in-built camera. There is the option to add sounds and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >visual effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the live footage, as well as edit material within the app. There is no save facility, which means your project needs to be sensible for the time you have before sharing to the site.</p>
<p>You will need to set up an account to be able to share your movies. However, for parents, this adds a reassuring level of moderation and support. Every video is moderated before it is shared. The set-up of the account is not too arduous. You are asked for your home country, your email address and your date of birth. All your videos will be anonymised as part of a stringent adherence to GDPR and safeguarding policies. The strength of this app is the infrastructure of a large brand that understands how to protect children. Be aware, your movie will become the property of the Lego group when uploaded.</p>
<p>Probably the most attractive selling point of this app is that there is no third-party advertising. Consequently, there are hours of uninterrupted fun offered.</p>

<li>For users 12+ with a focus on B2B adult target market</li>
<li>Unique feature – professional-level design features – with Instagram cropping guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Created by Bolandia Creative Inc., Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker is designed for a more sophisticated audience. It is available on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en_US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is aimed at users 12 and above, and there is a definite feel of a professional design package. The interface is a clean white with simple black icons for the function buttons. Essentially, the company is aiming the app at other businesses looking to produce marketing material.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the app cannot be used by Lego movie makers. The app has an intuitive interface, with simple icons that make it clear how the features can be used. There is the option to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and warmth of each image. You can also change the speed and size of images.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The apparent marketing leaning of this app is evident in the offer of Instagram crop guidelines, which will allow businesses to upload the stop-motion animations to the site. However, the in-app tutorials are excellent for helping younger people compose the Lego movies with a degree of sophistication that the other apps don’t provide. There is the option of an exposure lock, so the conditions stay the same for each photograph. You can use the ghosted image overlay, which allows you to check the difference from one frame to another.</p>
<p>Particularly useful, the grids allow you to clearly map the changes from one image to the next. This stop motion maker app helps you to track your stop-motion animation with some accuracy and it’s quite popular for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making Instagram Stop Motion Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>From the developers Yosuke Seki, this StopMotion camera is a simple tool for taking a series of images to produce your Lego movie and then play it back. You can now store the images within the app, which is new from Onion Cam1, which means you can come back to your movies and continue your work. You can also export your video with OnionCam 2.</p>
<p> The “onion” in the title comes from the onion-skin function which allows you to check the lapse between photographs. There is a translucent display of the picture you took last time – allowing you to gradually build up your time-lapse movie.</p>
<p>The guidelines are also a useful way to measure the changes you are making.</p>
<p>If you want an app that allows you to create a simple movie without too many bells and whistles, then this is the app for you. There are not too many advanced features, only the changing order function stands out. However, your young child should be able to use this app without much intervention from you.</p>

You could use a desk lamp for lighting or a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to add some professionalism should you wish.</p>
<p>Start by setting up your scene. You need a flat and stable surface. It needs to be at a height where you will be comfortable working for an extended period. If you set it up on your floor, you could regret this when the aches in your knees and back kick in. Keep your set in place by using masking tape, so it doesn’t move if you accidentally bump into it.</p>

<p>With everything in place, as well as a realistic mindset, it is time to choose the stop motion app that will help you produce the best Lego movies.</p>

                      alt="I Can Animate for iOS Interface "
                ></p>
<p>I Can Animate is a way to produce movies quickly and with little need for that much tech knowledge. You can use your iOS device, whether tablet or phone, to create and then share your videos. This app is produced by Kudlian Software Ltd and retails on different prices on Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>I Can Animate is unique in its simplicity. You use the camera on your iOS device, and the app will show you the differences between frames, so you can check your progress. This is called onion skinning and is essential to the success of your animation.</p>
<p>There are some basic editing features. These features include an ability to view the images on a timeline and duplicate or reorder these. You can also change the exposure, balance and focus settings to ensure there is a replication of conditions between photographs.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="I Can Animate for Andriod Interface "
                ></p>
<p>A useful option is the ability to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and capture your images without returning to your device. This means you can secure your phone or tablet and avoid knocking or changing the angle by tapping on the screen. Also helpful for streamlining the filming process is the inbuilt time-lapse feature. You can automatically capture images one after another without having to return to the camera.</p>
<p>You can then share these movies by exporting them to Facebook, YouTube or Dropbox.</p>
<h3 id="2-Stop-Motion-Studio-3"><a href="#2-Stop-Motion-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Stop Motion Studio"></a>2. Stop Motion Studio</h3><ul>

                      alt="Stop Motion Studio Interface "
                ></p>
<p>Stop Motion Studio, produced by Cateater, is an app offered for people age 4 and over and is available on iOS and Android – for your phone or your tablet. There is also a full-featured movie editing software that you can buy for your PC and Mac.</p>
<p>The app is free to download, with some free features. However, there are in-App purchases for some of the better features. You can purchase the Stop Motion Studio Pro app at the cost of $4.99 for Android devices, which then opens all the advanced features in the app.</p>
<p>The advanced features include a function to add and adjust audio, importing and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >cropping images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as 4K Ultra HD and much more. The Green Screen function is particularly smart, as this allows you to include a background, which is preloaded onto the phone.</p>
<p>Reviews are positive. Most note that the product appears simple to use – and you can get high-quality Lego movies without feeling daunted. However, the intuitive nature of the app design belies the smart tools available for your movie production. You can add in text, speech bubbles and titles. You can add facial expressions to your Lego figures. The eraser tool is wonderful, as you can delete unwanted objects from your images.</p>

                      alt="The Lego Movie  Maker"
                ></p>
<p>This branded movie maker is free on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.moviemaker.thelegomovie2" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is suitable for children aged 8 and above, so a little more advanced than the more basic I Can Animate – but it is designed only to be used on your phone, using the in-built camera. There is the option to add sounds and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >visual effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the live footage, as well as edit material within the app. There is no save facility, which means your project needs to be sensible for the time you have before sharing to the site.</p>
<p>You will need to set up an account to be able to share your movies. However, for parents, this adds a reassuring level of moderation and support. Every video is moderated before it is shared. The set-up of the account is not too arduous. You are asked for your home country, your email address and your date of birth. All your videos will be anonymised as part of a stringent adherence to GDPR and safeguarding policies. The strength of this app is the infrastructure of a large brand that understands how to protect children. Be aware, your movie will become the property of the Lego group when uploaded.</p>
<p>Probably the most attractive selling point of this app is that there is no third-party advertising. Consequently, there are hours of uninterrupted fun offered.</p>
<h3 id="4-LifeLapse-Stop-Motion-Maker-3"><a href="#4-LifeLapse-Stop-Motion-Maker-3" class="headerlink" title="4. LifeLapse Stop Motion Maker"></a>4. LifeLapse Stop Motion Maker</h3><ul>
<li>Free for the basic package</li>
<li>PRO subscription plan, after a 7-day trial</li>
<li>Pro Monthly $7.99&#x2F; Pro Yearly $39.99 on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/life-lapse-stop-motion-maker/id1281464378" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
<li>For users 12+ with a focus on B2B adult target market</li>
<li>Unique feature – professional-level design features – with Instagram cropping guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Created by Bolandia Creative Inc., Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker is designed for a more sophisticated audience. It is available on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en_US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is aimed at users 12 and above, and there is a definite feel of a professional design package. The interface is a clean white with simple black icons for the function buttons. Essentially, the company is aiming the app at other businesses looking to produce marketing material.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the app cannot be used by Lego movie makers. The app has an intuitive interface, with simple icons that make it clear how the features can be used. There is the option to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and warmth of each image. You can also change the speed and size of images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="LifeLapse Stop Motion Maker"
                ></p>
<p>The apparent marketing leaning of this app is evident in the offer of Instagram crop guidelines, which will allow businesses to upload the stop-motion animations to the site. However, the in-app tutorials are excellent for helping younger people compose the Lego movies with a degree of sophistication that the other apps don’t provide. There is the option of an exposure lock, so the conditions stay the same for each photograph. You can use the ghosted image overlay, which allows you to check the difference from one frame to another.</p>
<p>Particularly useful, the grids allow you to clearly map the changes from one image to the next. This stop motion maker app helps you to track your stop-motion animation with some accuracy and it’s quite popular for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making Instagram Stop Motion Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h3 id="5-Onion-Cam2-3"><a href="#5-Onion-Cam2-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Onion Cam2"></a>5. Onion Cam2</h3><ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>For children aged 4+</li>
<li>Unique feature – simplicity and the onion skin feature allowing you to easily track the stop motion effect</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/onion-cam2-stopmotion-camera.jpg"
                      alt="Onion Cam2 Stop Motion Maker"
                ></p>
<p>From the developers Yosuke Seki, this StopMotion camera is a simple tool for taking a series of images to produce your Lego movie and then play it back. You can now store the images within the app, which is new from Onion Cam1, which means you can come back to your movies and continue your work. You can also export your video with OnionCam 2.</p>
<p> The “onion” in the title comes from the onion-skin function which allows you to check the lapse between photographs. There is a translucent display of the picture you took last time – allowing you to gradually build up your time-lapse movie.</p>
<p>The guidelines are also a useful way to measure the changes you are making.</p>
<p>If you want an app that allows you to create a simple movie without too many bells and whistles, then this is the app for you. There are not too many advanced features, only the changing order function stands out. However, your young child should be able to use this app without much intervention from you.</p>

If you have both vital qualities, read on to understand how to maximise the effects in your film.</p>
<h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right-3"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1. Get your timing right</h3><p>If you want your characters to move quickly, then you need fewer images and movements per second. If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p>
<h3 id="2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural-3"><a href="#2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Making your characters’ movements natural"></a>2. Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle-3"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li>
<li>The toe on this foot then descends</li>
<li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li>
<li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect-3"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

<h4 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>Finding ways to produce content that stands out on social media is becoming increasingly difficult as video content is growing more popular. Online stop motion makers provide a simple way to use photos and videos to create attention-grabbing videos.</p>
