#### 4. Blur face with Adobe Premiere Pro CC professional video editor

**Premiere Pro CC** is Adobe’s dedicated video editing software. There are many video editors out there that have some experience in Photoshop as well, and since there’s a chance they work in Premiere Pro CC due to how similar the UI of both of these products is, we’ve decided to give this NLE some attention as well. Available for both **MacOS** and **Windows**.

**How to Blur the Faces in Premiere Pro?**

1. **Select** the video clip in the timeline.
2. Access the **Effects** tab, and then click **Video Effects,** and then **Stylize**.
3. Click **Mosaic**.
4. Go to the **Effects Control** tab, and pick the shape of blurred area. The elliptical and 4-point polygon mask options are what most people use when blurring faces in particular.
5. Drag the **Mask** over the intended area
6. Adjust **Positioning**, **Scale**, **and**/**or Rotation** to your liking.
7. You can fine-tune the effect further by adjusting the **Mask Expansion,** the **Horizontal and Vertical** blocks the mosaic effect is composed of, and the **Feather**

What sort of video editing software you go for when you want to edit the face in videos is ultimately up to you - we’ve only expressed our personal preferences in the hopes that it might help some of the people that are interested in the subject. Most of the steps present in this list are similar to each other and you will find that once you learn how to do this trick, you will become far more familiarized with all the various effects available to you.

Whether Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, Titanfall or Destiny is your favorite video game or you prefer more nostalgic style game play like Mario Kart 8 or NBA 2K15, chances are you want to record something fantastic that happens (or that you do!) within the game. YouTube is filled with videos of gamers killing the newest games or reviewing new editions on brand new platforms. How do they make those awesome videos and capture all of their great plays? Simple—when you know which programs to use to take advantage of some of the latest software tools that can record your gaming screen effortlessly as you play!

[Wondershare Filmstock Gaming Video Editing Skils](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/learn-gaming-video-editing-skills-banner.png)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle&spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb)

## Record Video Games with Fraps

[Fraps](http://www.fraps.com/) is the old standby that is easy to use, even for recording newbies, and remains the most popular choice for recording video gameplay. Aside from its simple user interface, it can display game benchmarks and easily make adjustments for framerates and sizing. Fraps was designed specifically to run while your games are playing and record in high quality, and it does a great job at that dedicated task. While some users complain that the size of Fraps files are huge, you can use a different application to compress the files for uploading and sharing.

![wondershare video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/fraps.jpg)

## Use liteCam for game recording

The [liteCam game recording software](https://www.litecam.net/en/) can capture your game at up to 60 fps, and it will record OpenGL and DirectX games that other software cannot. While you simply choose from preset keys to set up your recording, which makes it easier to use, there is no option to capture still shots which some people like to have. Even though it does not have quite as many extra settings and tools as a lot of other video game recording software, it does produce good-quality recordings that many gamers appreciate for their use.

![wondershare video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/litecam.jpg)

## Use Wondershare Filmora for game capturing

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a multipurpose video software tool with a built-in webcam recorder which allows you to easily capture with your webcam. Audio recording is also made easy, perfect for game players who want to showcase your favorite games with your followers.

Aside from its simple user interface, it can display game benchmarks and easily make adjustments for framerates and sizing. Fraps was designed specifically to run while your games are playing and record in high quality, and it does a great job at that dedicated task. While some users complain that the size of Fraps files are huge, you can use a different application to compress the files for uploading and sharing.

## Use liteCam for game recording

The [liteCam game recording software](https://www.litecam.net/en/) can capture your game at up to 60 fps, and it will record OpenGL and DirectX games that other software cannot.

Even though it does not have quite as many extra settings and tools as a lot of other video game recording software, it does produce good-quality recordings that many gamers appreciate for their use.
