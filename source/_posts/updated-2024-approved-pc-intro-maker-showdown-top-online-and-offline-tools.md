What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users.

### 03Smart Phone App - Transcribe

As mentioned earlier, there are apps out there that work in pretty much the same way. Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced **speech-to-text** functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe.

![Voice Typing Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%205.png)

### 05Apple Dictation (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)

If you’re a Mac user, then the second item on this list was probably of not much use to you. But, don’t worry, Windows Dictates has a Mac/iOS counterpart It’s in the form of Apple Dictation Again, it was set up to increase accessibility for users with visual impairment, but it can be pretty useful as well for the times when your hands are too busy to actively type your thoughts down.
