## Mastering Titles in FCPX: Essential Skills for Video Editors

# How to Add Titles in Final Cut Pro X

We add text titles to our projects to tell the audience something they can't figure out on their own, such as the title of our program, the name of the person speaking, or technical details about a subject.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.

#### DEFINITIONS

Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:

* Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.
* Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called "supers" or "keys."
* Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.
* Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the "lower-third" of the screen.
* Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.

#### JUST THE BASICS

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles001.jpg)

I'd like to introduce "Yertle," he's a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)

At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg)

In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg)

Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I'll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)

NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.

You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.

Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg)

This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg)

If you look right in the center of the screen, you'll see the word "Title." Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.

Select and delete that full-screen title.

There's one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg)

Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I've added a few custom titles to my system.)

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg)

Let's add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.

NOTE: I'm using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg)

Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others... You can delete this title now.

So, we:

* Add titles using keyboard shortcuts
* Drag titles from the Title Browser
* Change position by dragging the title
* Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip
* Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key

#### CHANGING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg)

Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I've changed my title to "An Undersea Adventure."

NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I'll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.

All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.

#### FORMATTING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.

Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.

NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

If you want a fast way to format text, click the word "Normal" at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.

NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg)

The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment... all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I've changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.

While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:

* Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.
* Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.
* Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg)

The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg)

However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg)

After making a few changes in the Inspector, here's the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!

#### ACTION SAFE/TITLE SAFE ZONES

Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.

While much of today's video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.

Titles015

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg)

Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select "Show Action Safe/Title Safe Zones."

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles016.jpg)

This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called "Action Safe," the inner one is called "Title Safe." Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.

When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.

Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.

#### SUMMARY

Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what's going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.

At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg)

In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg)

Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I'll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)

NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.

You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.

Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg)

This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg)

If you look right in the center of the screen, you'll see the word "Title." Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.

Select and delete that full-screen title.

There's one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg)

Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I've added a few custom titles to my system.)

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg)

Let's add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.

NOTE: I'm using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg)

Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others... You can delete this title now.

So, we:

* Add titles using keyboard shortcuts
* Drag titles from the Title Browser
* Change position by dragging the title
* Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip
* Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key

#### CHANGING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg)

Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I've changed my title to "An Undersea Adventure."

NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I'll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.

All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.

#### FORMATTING TEXT

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.

Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.

NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg)

If you want a fast way to format text, click the word "Normal" at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.

NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg)

The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment... all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I've changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.

While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:

* Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.
* Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.
* Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg)

The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg)

However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg)

After making a few changes in the Inspector, here's the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!

#### ACTION SAFE/TITLE SAFE ZONES

Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.

While much of today's video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.

Titles015

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg)

Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select "Show Action Safe/Title Safe Zones."

![remote](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles016.jpg)

This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called "Action Safe," the inner one is called "Title Safe." Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.

When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.

Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.

#### SUMMARY

Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what's going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.

## Slow Down Your Videos: A Step-by-Step Guide to VLC's Slow Motion Feature

While the files of the most common formats like MP4, WAV, etc. may look identical, they might be compiled using varied codecs which may or may not support any random player that you install on your PC.

Furthermore, the app is available for almost every platform, i.e., Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android, and is absolutely free to download and use.

With that said, the following sections explain how to manage the playback speed of a video while using VLC media player to add a slow motion effect to video. Here you will learn **how to play slow motion on VLC** on Windows, Mac, and iOS/Android, and also how to set the default speed for the app so that every time a video is played, the speed remains according to your preference.

04 [How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?

VLC is one of the [best media players to play videos in slow motion](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:

**Step 1: Start Video Playback**

Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click **Media** from the menu bar at the top, click **Open File** from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

![play video slow motion on vlc slower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-slower.jpg)

**Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)**

You can press the left square bracket ‘**\[**‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘**\=**’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘**\]**’ increases the speed by 0.10x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 2: How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?

The process of slowing down the video playback in VLC on a Mac computer is almost identical to that in Windows. You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Open and Pause the Video**

Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to **Open With** from the context menu, and click **VLC** from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the **Pause** button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Click **Playback** from the menu bar at the top, and drag the **Playback Speed** slider to the left to reduce the speed of the video.

### Play Video in Slow Motion on Android with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Launch VLC on your Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations), locate and open the video in VLC, tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Pause** button from the bottom to pause the playback.

**Step 2: Set a Slower Playback Speed**

Tap the **More** icon from the bottom-right corner, tap **Playback speed** from the menu that appears, and drag the slider that is present at the bottom to the left to reduce the speed.

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on Android

**Note:** At the time of this writing, the Android version of VLC doesn’t allow you to set a global default playback speed. However, you can set it on a per video basis. This means that every time that video is played, the playback speed will remain what you set for it. You must do this for each video in your VLC library individually.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

**Conclusion**

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same.

It is pretty convenient to reduce the playback speed in VLC media player regardless of the platform or device you are using. While the processes of getting the job might be different, the principle behind it remains the same. When on Windows, the playback speed can be decreased to 0.02x and can be increased to more than 100x. This facility is not available on Mac, iOS, or Android platforms. Also, if you want, you can set the default playback speed for the videos so that every time a clip is played, the pace remains what you specified as default.

## Part 1: How to Play Video in Slow Motion Effects on Windows with VLC?

VLC is one of the [best media players to play videos in slow motion](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can follow the instructions that are given below to learn how to play a video in slow motion in VLC on a Windows PC:

**Step 1: Start Video Playback**

Launch VLC on your Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click **Media** from the menu bar at the top, click **Open File** from the menu, and locate and open a video that you want to watch in slow motion. If VLC is your default media player, simply double-clicking the clip automatically opens the file in the app.

![open file to play slow motion on vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-file-to-play-slow-motion-on-vlc.jpg)

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements of 0.10x)**

Once the playback begins, press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to pause the video. Next, go to the **Playback** menu from the top, go to **Speed**, and click **Slower (fine)** once. This will reduce the speed to 0.90x. Clicking **Slower (fine)** again will further slow down the video to 0.80x speed. You can repeat this process until you reduce the speed to your desired level. Press **Spacebar** again to resume the playback in slow motion.

**Note:** The lowest speed that you can go to using this process is 0.03x.

![vlc playback slower slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-playback-slower-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Reduce the Playback Speed (In Decrements in Percentage)**

Pause the playback and go to **Playback** \> **Speed** as explained in the previous step. From the list that comes up, click **Slower** (the last option). This will reduce the speed to 0.67x. Click **Slower** again and the speed will further go down to 0.50x. You can repeat this process until you reach your desired playback speed. Press **Spacebar** to resume the playback in slow motion. With this method, you can reduce the speed to as low as 0.02x.

**Note:** You can click **Normal** from the **Speed** submenu to play the video at normal speed.

![play video slow motion on vlc slower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-slower.jpg)

**Step 4: Using the Shortcut Keys (Optional)**

You can press the left square bracket ‘**\[**‘ on your keyboard to reduce the speed in decrements of 0.10x. To get back to the normal speed, press the equals to ‘**\=**’ key. Likewise, pressing the right square bracket ‘**\]**’ increases the speed by 0.10x.

**Note:** As it is with the **Slower (fine)** and **Slower** options, you can use **Faster (fine)** to add 0.10x increments to the speed, and **Faster** to increase percentage-wise. Also, if **Faster (fine)** is clicked repeatedly or its shortcut key is used multiple times, the speed can be increased up to 31.25x. On the other hand, by using the **Faster** option repeatedly, the speed can be increased to more than 100x.

## Part 2: How to Play Slow Motion Effects on Mac with VLC?

The process of slowing down the video playback in VLC on a Mac computer is almost identical to that in Windows. You can learn how to get this done by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Open and Pause the Video**

Locate and right-click the video that you want to play in slow motion, go to **Open With** from the context menu, and click **VLC** from the submenu. Once the clip opens, click the **Pause** button from the bottom as explained in the previous section.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Click **Playback** from the menu bar at the top, and drag the **Playback Speed** slider to the left to reduce the speed of the video.

![play video slow motion on vlc mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-slow-motion-on-vlc-mac.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Click anywhere on the screen to close the **Playback** menu, and then click the **Play** button from the bottom to resume the video playback in slow motion.

## Part 3: How to Control Playback Speed in VLC Media Player on Android and iOS?

Although the playback speed of a video on both Android and iOS devices can be controlled with a slider, the location where the controller is placed on the two platforms varies, and so does the process of reaching there. Both the methods are explained below for your convenience:

### Play Video in Slow Motion on Android with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Launch VLC on your Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations), locate and open the video in VLC, tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Pause** button from the bottom to pause the playback.

**Step 2: Set a Slower Playback Speed**

Tap the **More** icon from the bottom-right corner, tap **Playback speed** from the menu that appears, and drag the slider that is present at the bottom to the left to reduce the speed. Alternatively, you can also repeatedly tap the down arrow that is present at the right of the slider to slow down the speed in the decrements of 0.05x.

![play speed slow motion vlc android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-speed-slow-motion-vlc-android.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and when the **Playback speed** slider disappears, tap the screen one more time. Now, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the video playback.

### Play Video in Slow Motion on iPhone with VLC

**Step 1: Pause the Playback**

Assuming that you have already added the video to the VLC library by connecting it to iTunes, launch the app on your iOS device (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations). Tap the video that you want to play in slow motion, and then tap the **Pause** icon from the bottom.

**Step 2: Reduce the Playback Speed**

Tap anywhere on the screen, and tap the **Clock** icon from the lower-left corner. Next, drag the **Playback speed** slider to the left to reduce the playback speed.

![vlc iphone playback speed slow motion effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-iphone-playback-speed-slow-motion-effect.jpg)

**Step 3: Resume the Playback**

Right after decreasing the speed, tap the **Play** icon from the bottom to resume the playback. If the controllers disappear, you can tap anywhere on the screen again, and then tap the **Play** icon.

## Part 4: How to Set up the Default Playback Speed on VLC?

The processes of setting up default playback speed on different platforms and devices vary. For your convenience, all of them are explained below:

### Set up Default Playback Speed in VLC on Windows

1. Go to **Tools** \> **Preferences** in VLC media player, and then click the **All** button from the **Show settings** section at the bottom.
2. Select **Input / Codecs** from the left pane of the **Advanced Preferences** box, and then specify your preferred speed in the **Playback speed** field that is present under the **Playback control** section on the right window
3. Click **Save** to save the changes

![change vlc media player default speed mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-vlc-media-player-default-speed-mac.jpg)

### How to Change VLC Media Player Default Speed on Android

**Note:** At the time of this writing, the Android version of VLC doesn’t allow you to set a global default playback speed. However, you can set it on a per video basis. This means that every time that video is played, the playback speed will remain what you set for it. You must do this for each video in your VLC library individually.

* Launch VLC, and then tap **More** from the bottom-right corner; next, tap **SETTINGS** from the upper-left area;
* Tap **Video** from the **Extra settings** section, and then check the **Save Playback Speed** box

* Tap **Default playback speed** from the **GENERIC** section, and then tap to select a playback speed from the available list to set it as the default.

An aspect ratio in the simplest terms is defined as the relationship of the image width with its height. Denoted by x: y, where x is the width and h, is the height, an aspect ratio defines the shape of an image and can be different for different platforms and sites. Thus, one image with a certain aspect ratio might not fit perfectly on another site or a platform that supports a different aspect ratio. For instance, an image created for Facebook might not appear to be right in size when posted on Instagram. Similarly, an image seen on a smartphone will have a different look when watched on a big TV screen.

It is important to have the right aspect ratio as a set or recommended by the site or the platform so that they look appealing and interesting. To change ratio of image, there are several tools available.
