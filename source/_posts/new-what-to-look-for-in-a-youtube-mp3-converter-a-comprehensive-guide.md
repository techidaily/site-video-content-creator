Nowadays people tend to use high-resolution cameras in mobile devices instead of the old large video cameras to capture videos.

You can make use of some free tools to turn it back to normal orientation (instead of turning your neck to watch the video). Here are some easy-to-use tools (software and online solutions) that allow you to rotate, flip or turn your videos without hassle.
