It has less editing options provided by VirtualDub, but the built-in video editor also provides several basic video editing functions such as crop, trim, rotate, add filters and more. On top of that, you can download videos directly from the online sites or create and burn your own videos onto a DVD. The preset of best video settings for playback on a variety of portable devices makes it even more convenient.

#### 3\. [Virtual VCR](http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualvcr/?source=directory)

#### 4\. [Free Video Dub](http://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-Video-Dub.htm)
