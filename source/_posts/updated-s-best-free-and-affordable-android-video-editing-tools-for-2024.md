Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.
