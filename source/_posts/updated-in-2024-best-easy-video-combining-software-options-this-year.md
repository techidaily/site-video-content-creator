Even though FotoJet is primarily a platform for design and photo editing, it still enables its users to create video collages. However, **you can only use photos to create video collages**, which limits your options significantly. The process of making a new video collage is easy, as you just have to **pick one of the available templates** and proceed to **upload the images** you’d like to include in the collage you’re making. After customizing the template you can share your creations on social media, but keep in mind that the free version of the platform offers only limited capabilities.

VidDay enables you to create a new video collage in just three simple steps.

You will then be asked to **add the dates and all other relevant information**, and to upload the videos you’d like to include in the collage. The only downside is that the content you create with VidDay can’t be longer than **two minutes** and that you have to choose a subscription plan if you want to export your videos in 720p resolution.
