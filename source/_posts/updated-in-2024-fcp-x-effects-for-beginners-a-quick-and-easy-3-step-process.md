## FCP X Effects for Beginners: A Quick and Easy 3-Step Process

# Simple Guide to FCP X: How To Add Effects in 3 Steps

There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Find and apply an effect](#part1)
* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)
* [Extra credit](#part4)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

## Take a Screenshot, Share the Fun: A Guide to PS4 Online Sharing

# How Can I Share PS4 Screenshots Online

 You can now easily capture screenshots on your PS4 with the inclusion of the new _SHARE_ button on the DualShock 4 controller. This can be done either through the short or long press settings configured for your _SHARE_ button. Kindly follow me through the different options that you have on how you can capture and share your PS4 screenshots; **Option 1: Through the SHARE button** or; **Option 2: On A Separate Platform**.

## Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button

 You can’t miss the _SHARE_ button on the new controller for the latest PS4\. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on _SHARE_ button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your _Share Settings_ to _Easy Screenshots_ where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.

![PS4 DualShock 4 Controller](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/ps4-dualshock-4-controller.jpg)

### 1 Upload Screenshots

 Go back to the Share’s interface and select _Upload Screenshot_. Simply browse through the screenshot that you’ll like to share or upload and then click once to select it. You can also hit _Options_ instead to preview the details of the screenshot before.

![PS4 share options](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/ps4-share-options.jpg)

### 2 Share to Facebook or Twitter

 You can choose to share your screenshots online through Facebook or Twitter. Please take note that you will have to log-in to your Facebook or Twitter account prior to uploading your screenshots and be prompted with a message to give your permission. You’ll only have to go through this once.

![PS4 upload screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/ps4-upload-screenshot.jpg)

### 3 Insert Comment

 Select either one account to share your captured screenshots and before you proceed with the _Share_ button, Name it as well as type in whatever comments you have. Now you’re ready to go!

![PS4 upload screenshot Twitter](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-converter-ultimate/ps4-upload-screenshot-twitter.jpg)

## Use third party software for screenshot sharing

 You can also share your PS4 captured screenshots on a separate platform such as the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can easily drag-and-drop your screenshots on the interface, stitch, personalize with effects and even insert your favorite track as the background music.

 Other than that, you can also convert your screenshots to a file format that’s compatible with your portable device; uploading onto YouTube (with additional options to share on Twitter as well as Facebook); burn your own DVD and much more. Download the trial version and try it out right now.

 You can now easily capture screenshots on your PS4 with the inclusion of the new _SHARE_ button on the DualShock 4 controller. This can be done either through the short or long press settings configured for your _SHARE_ button. Kindly follow me through the different options that you have on how you can capture and share your PS4 screenshots; **Option 1: Through the SHARE button** or; **Option 2: On A Separate Platform**.

## Capture screenshots on PS4 with SHARE button

 You can’t miss the _SHARE_ button on the new controller for the latest PS4\. It’s sitting on the left-hand side of the touch pad (as shown in the screenshot below). A short press on _SHARE_ button (by default) will take you into the Share’s interface. In order to capture a screen shot, you’ll need to perform a long press. Alternatively, change your _Share Settings_ to _Easy Screenshots_ where the press works in contrary of the defaulted settings.
