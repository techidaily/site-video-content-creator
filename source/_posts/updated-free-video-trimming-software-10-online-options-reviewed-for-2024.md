# 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers to Edit Videos Quickly

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.

Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and/or malicious.

If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.

## Why Free Online Video Trimmers?

Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit & Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.

The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn't allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.

## 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers

There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.

Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer [Blender.org](https://www.blender.org/), is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.

In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.

So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.

#### 1. [Wondershare Filmora Online Video Trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-free-online-video-trimmer.jpg)

The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.

The [free online video trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.

Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.

Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named **Filmora**. it's very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.

#### 3. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.

Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.

There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn't make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.

#### 4. [YouTube Creator Studio](https://www.youtube.com/creators/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-interface.jpg)

Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.

YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.

Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.

#### 5. [Video Toolbox](http://www.videotoolbox.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.

The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.

This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.

#### 6. [WeVideo Editor](https://www.wevideo.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-editor-interface.jpg)

The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.

For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.

#### 7. [Wincreator Video Cutter](http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wincreator-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.

The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn't lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.

#### 8. [Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/Video-Editor)

This is a fully featured multi-faceted tool for editing videos. It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.

If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.

#### 9. [Aconvert Video Cutter](https://www.aconvert.com/video/split/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.

You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.

#### 10. [Clip Champ](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-interface.jpg)

This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.

It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.

If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.

#### 11. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-interface.jpg)

This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.

This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.

## Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?

There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.

It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.

If this article helped you, then feel free to share our 10 best free online video trimmers article on social media. Let your friends know which free online video trimmer you like the best.

#### 3. [Online Video Cutter](https://online-video-cutter.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.

Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.

There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn't make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.

#### 4. [YouTube Creator Studio](https://www.youtube.com/creators/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-interface.jpg)

Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.

YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.

Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.

#### 5. [Video Toolbox](http://www.videotoolbox.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.

The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.

This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.

#### 6. [WeVideo Editor](https://www.wevideo.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-editor-interface.jpg)

The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.

For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.

#### 7. [Wincreator Video Cutter](http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wincreator-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.

The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn't lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.

#### 8. [Kizoa](https://www.kizoa.com/Video-Editor)

This is a fully featured multi-faceted tool for editing videos. It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.

If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.

#### 9. [Aconvert Video Cutter](https://www.aconvert.com/video/split/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-video-cutter-interface.jpg)

This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.

You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.

#### 10. [Clip Champ](https://clipchamp.com/en/video-editor)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clipchamp-interface.jpg)

This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.

It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.

If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.

#### 11. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-interface.jpg)

This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.

This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.

## Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?

There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.

It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.

If this article helped you, then feel free to share our 10 best free online video trimmers article on social media. Let your friends know which free online video trimmer you like the best.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.

Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and/or malicious.

If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.

## Why Free Online Video Trimmers?

Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit & Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.

The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn't allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.

## 10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers

There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.

Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer [Blender.org](https://www.blender.org/), is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.

In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.

So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.

#### 1. [Wondershare Filmora Online Video Trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![free online video trimmer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-free-online-video-trimmer.jpg)

The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.

The [free online video trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.

Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.

Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named **Filmora**. it's very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.

## Design Your Own Face Online: Best Free Tools and Websites

While signing up for a social media account, you may not want to use your real photograph as your profile picture, but at the same time, you might not find it ethical to use someone else’s image either. This is where a **face generation portal** comes into play. You can easily **create a virtual face** that looks almost like you and sometimes even better with a face generator.

Similarly, run a business where you want to publish your clients’ reviews without showing their real photos as they might not like the idea. You can use a good face generator online tool to create a virtual face that resembles their look and post it along with their feedback.

Considering the above scenarios and many others that may come up over time, the following list some of the best free online face generators to create fake faces.

## Best Free Online Face Generators to Get Virtual Faces in 2022

### 1\. Generated Photos: Faces

**Website**: <https://generated.photos/faces>

This online portal enables you to create virtual faces by specifying the physical attributes of a character, such as gender, age, hair color, eye color, and much more. You can be as creative as you want to generate a face that appears somewhat like you with the available options. Once a look is generated, you can download and use it as needed.

The steps that are given below explain how you can use Generated Photos’ Faces section to create and download a virtual face:

* Launch your favorite web browser and go to the URL given above, and then you will see all free AI-generated photos on this website.

![generated photos layout](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/generated-photos-layout.jpg)

* Use the filters given in the left pane to define your character's physical attributes and click **Apply** from the bottom to get the results. You can customize the face from its head post, gender, age, hair, eye, and emotion aspects.
* Click your preferred character from the AI-generated faces, and then click **Download** from the page that opens next. Choose your preferred method to sign up, and then sign in to download the virtual face to your PC.

### 2\. Generated Photos: Anonymizer

**Website**: <https://generated.photos/anonymizer>

Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.

However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.

You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:

* Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click **Upload photo;**
* Select and upload your photo from your PC to the portal and wait while Anonymizer uses AI to generate similar faces.
* Click the photo that you want to use, and when the next page opens up, click Sign up or sign in to download the photo and use it wherever needed

![recreate face with anonymizer online face generators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recreate-face-with-anonymizer-online-face-generators.jpg)

### 3\. Generated Photos Face Generator

Website: [](https://generated.photos/face-generator)<https://generated.photos/face-generator>

This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.

Generated Photos Face Generator tool is a good choice for people who don’t want to upload any photos online, and need to customize the face at maximum.

Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:

* Go to the website give above and then click the **Generate faces**
* Select the parameters accordingly based on your needs. You can generate the same face young or old with different emotions.

![generated photos face generator online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/generated-photos-face-generator-online.jpg)

You can then download the generated photo by signing up or logging in, but you need to pay to remove the watermark.

### 4\. Massless

**Website:** [https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai](https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/)

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

* Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., **Nose**).
* Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., **Nose**), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.
* Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.
* Click **Download images** from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.

![massless online face generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/massless-online-face-generator.jpg)

### 5\. This Person Does Not Exist

**Website:** <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/>

This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.

You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:

* Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;
* Click **Another** from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.
* Click **Save image** from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.

**Note:** Different browsers may have this feature with other names

![thispersondoesnotexist free online face generators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thispersondoesnotexist-free-online-face-generators.jpg)

### 6\. BoredHumans

**Website**: <https://boredhumans.com/faces.php>

This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.

You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:

* Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click **Generate Another Fake Human** if you don’t like the one that appears;
* Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the **Generate A Human** button to create a less realistic image of a random person.

![free online face generators boredhumans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-boredhumans.jpg)

* Right-click the image and click **Save image** to download the photo to your PC; and then get to the default download location to access the photo and use it wherever needed.

### 7\. faceMaker

M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones

As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about **M4R converters** and how to use them.

#### In this article

01 [Why Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Convert M4A to M4R?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Convert MP3 to M4R?**

Let's start with a bit of an overview of M4R and **M4R Converter**s first! We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let's talk about what an **M4R converter** is usually like. Then, let's talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.

### 01**M4R Converter Key Features**

Here's a list of some key features that you should look for in an **M4R Converter**:

**●** Your average **M4R Converter** should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.

**●** It should also allow you to 'extract' audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)

**●** The **M4R** **converter** would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.

**●** A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won't have to undergo the process again and again.

**●** Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.

### 02**Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R**

There are several reasons why you might want to use an **M4R converter** to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:

**●** **Creating iPhone Ringtone**: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you're a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.

**●** **Transfer Ringtones to iPhone**: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!

**●** **Making General M4R Audio**: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.

## Part 2 **How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?**

Now, let's start with a more in-depth tutorial on how to actually convert MP3 to M4R! In this case, specifically, we'll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!

### 01**How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?**

As mentioned, the first **M4R Converter** on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we'll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you're curious, the tool we'll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!**

First! Open the **M4R Converter online** tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:

![Open M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%203.png)

****Step 2: Upload MP3 File**

Next, it's time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!

Usually, all you have to do for this is click the 'Upload' button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the **M4R converter** may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)

![Upload MP3 File for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%204.png)

****Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!**

Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)

![Select M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%205.png)

****Step 4: Select Convert!**

The next thing you need to do is to simply select the 'CONVERT' option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!

![Select Convert Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%206.png)

****Step 5: Download Converter M4R!**

Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click 'DOWNLOAD' and you're done!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%207.png)

### 01**2\. How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?**

Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we'll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple's own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you'll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.

****Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!**

Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to 'File' > 'Add File to Library' or 'Add Folder to Library' to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!

![Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%208.png)

****Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!**

Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you'll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.

This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the 'OPTIONS' tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you'll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!

Click 'OK' when done in order to save any changes!

![Adjust Ringtone Timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%209.png)

****Step 3: Convert to Version!**

Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the 'FILE' tab (shown in the image below) and then click 'CONVERT' > 'Create Version'!

![Create Version of MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2010.png)

****Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!**

After the conversion has been finished, locate the file's destination folder. You'll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.

Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click 'YES' to confirm the change! In this way, you've managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!

![Change from M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2011.png)

### 01**3\. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?**

For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we've decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we'll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)

****Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!**

First, launch the **M4R converter** software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we're showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:

![Launch Program and Connect iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2012.png)

****Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker**

Once the program has been launched, go to the 'MUSIC' tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)

![Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2013.png)

****Step 3: Select Music File!**

A secondary window should appear after you select the 'Ringtone Maker' option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.

For the software that we're using as an example, you can choose to upload 'Local Music' from your computer or 'Device Music' from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We'll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!

![Upload Locally or Through Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2014.png)

****Step 4: Local Upload - Open!**

If you select 'Local Music' a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click 'OPEN!'

![Browse Music File Locally](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2015.png)

****Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!**

For the 'Device Music' option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click 'Select' when done!

![Browse Music on Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2016.png)

****Step 6: TunesGo Library!**

For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the 'MUSIC' tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select 'Ringtone Maker' on the pop-up that appears (shown below).

![Software Library Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2017.png)

****Step 7: Trim and Save!**

Once you've chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:

**●** Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)

**●** Use the 'Ringtone Audition' option to preview your trimmed audio.

**●** And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!

In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!

## Part 3 **How to Convert M4A to M4R?**

Another Apple extension file that you might recognize is M4A! This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as 'compressed' Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It's also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.

### 01**How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?**

This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we'll be going through the easiest method of converting **M4A to M4R** on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.

****Step 1: View File Extensions!**

The first step to **convert M4A to M4R** is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have 'File Name Extensions' selected under the 'VIEW' tab (pointed out in the image below).

This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.

![View File Extensions on Windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2019.png)

****Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!**

Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the 'Rename' option on the pop-up that appears.

![Rename M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2020.png)

****Step 3: Change M4A to M4R**

With 'File Name Extensions' on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!

Meaning, you can **change M4A to M4R** without worrying about it being unusable!

![Change M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2021.png)

### 01**2\. How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes**

This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it's important to provide this perspective we'll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!

****Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!**

First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select 'Add File' or 'Add folder' under the 'FILE' tab).

![Add File to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2022.png)

****Step 2: Create to M4R!**

Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it's selected and then select 'Create Version' for it (the option can be found under the 'FILE' tab > 'Convert'!)

![Create version of M4A](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2023.png)

****Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R**

Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the **M4A to M4R** simply by rewriting the file extension name.

![Convert M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2024.png)

### 03**How to Convert M4A to M4R Online**

For this next part, we'll be echoing another one of our earlier tutorials! Only, this time, we'll be focusing on converting **M4A to M4R online** with an **M4R converter online**! Specifically, the one we introduced previously — Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Online M4R Converter**

Audio Tool Set offers an **M4A to M4R** converter that you can select under the 'CONVERT AUDIO' tab!

![Audio Tool Set - M4A to M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2025.png)

****Step 2: Upload M4A File!**

Once you've been moved to the free **M4A to M4R** converter, select the 'UPLOAD M4A' option to browse your PC for the M4A file that you want to convert.

![Upload M4A file for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2026.png)

****Step 3: Confirm M4R Conversion Format!**

If you're using the **M4A to M4R Converter** you can skip this step. But, if not, make sure that you have chosen 'M4R' as your desired conversion format!

![Confirm M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2027.png)

****Step 4: Convert M4A to M4R!**

With all of that in order, select 'CONVERT' to move forward.

![Convert M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2028.png)

****Step 5: Download Converted M4R!**

Finally, with the conversion done, you can now download the converted file to use as you will! This can be done by selecting the 'DOWNLOAD' option!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2029.png)

### 04**How to Create and How to Open an M4A File?**

If you want detailed instructions on how to create an M4A file, please refer to Part 2, Section 2 of this article, or Part 3, Section 2\. In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the 'Create Version' feature that iTunes offers.

In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!

![iTunes Software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2030.png)

### 05**Which Other Formats M4A Can Be Converted into and Why?**

There are numerous file formats that you can convert M4A into. If you want examples: you can **convert M4A to M4R**, MP3 to M4A, WAV to M4A, FLAC to M4A, OGG to M4A, WMA to M4A, and so much more! Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such **M4A converter** that we recommend is Filmora Pro!

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is an all-in-one video editing software that will allow you to **convert M4A to M4R** (and all sorts of other audio and video file formats) so that you can make use of the file for all your projects! The best part of using a video editor like Filmora, of course, is that once you've converted the file, you can use it immediately — there's no need to wait, you can finish your project right then and there, making it unnecessary for you to go searching for any other solution.

Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to 'File' > 'Add File to Library' or 'Add Folder to Library' to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!

![Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%208.png)

****Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!**

Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you'll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.

This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the 'OPTIONS' tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you'll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!

Click 'OK' when done in order to save any changes!

![Adjust Ringtone Timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%209.png)

****Step 3: Convert to Version!**

Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the 'FILE' tab (shown in the image below) and then click 'CONVERT' > 'Create Version'!

![Create Version of MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2010.png)

****Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!**

After the conversion has been finished, locate the file's destination folder. You'll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.

Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click 'YES' to confirm the change! In this way, you've managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!

![Change from M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2011.png)

### 01**3\. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?**

For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we've decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we'll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)

****Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!**

First, launch the **M4R converter** software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we're showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:

Once the program has been launched, go to the 'MUSIC' tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)

![Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2013.png)

****Step 3: Select Music File!**

A secondary window should appear after you select the 'Ringtone Maker' option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.

For the software that we're using as an example, you can choose to upload 'Local Music' from your computer or 'Device Music' from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We'll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!

![Upload Locally or Through Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2014.png)

![Browse Music File Locally](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2015.png)

****Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!**

For the 'Device Music' option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click 'Select' when done!

![Browse Music on Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2016.png)

****Step 6: TunesGo Library!**

![Software Library Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2017.png)

****Step 7: Trim and Save!**

Once you've chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:

**●** Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)

**●** Use the 'Ringtone Audition' option to preview your trimmed audio.

**●** And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!

In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!

## Part 3 **How to Convert M4A to M4R?**

Another Apple extension file that you might recognize is M4A! This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as 'compressed' Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It's also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.

### 01**How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?**

This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we'll be going through the easiest method of converting **M4A to M4R** on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.

****Step 1: View File Extensions!**

The first step to **convert M4A to M4R** is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have 'File Name Extensions' selected under the 'VIEW' tab (pointed out in the image below).

This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.

![View File Extensions on Windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2019.png)

****Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!**

Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the 'Rename' option on the pop-up that appears.

![Rename M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2020.png)

****Step 3: Change M4A to M4R**

With 'File Name Extensions' on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!

Meaning, you can **change M4A to M4R** without worrying about it being unusable!

![Change M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2021.png)

### 01**2\. How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes**

This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it's important to provide this perspective we'll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!

****Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!**

First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select 'Add File' or 'Add folder' under the 'FILE' tab).

![Add File to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2022.png)

****Step 2: Create to M4R!**

Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it's selected and then select 'Create Version' for it (the option can be found under the 'FILE' tab > 'Convert'!)

![Create version of M4A](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2023.png)

****Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R**

Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the **M4A to M4R** simply by rewriting the file extension name.

![Convert M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2024.png)

### 03**How to Convert M4A to M4R Online**

For this next part, we'll be echoing another one of our earlier tutorials! Only, this time, we'll be focusing on converting **M4A to M4R online** with an **M4R converter online**! Specifically, the one we introduced previously — Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Online M4R Converter**

Audio Tool Set offers an **M4A to M4R** converter that you can select under the 'CONVERT AUDIO' tab!

![Audio Tool Set - M4A to M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2025.png)

****Step 2: Upload M4A File!**

Once you've been moved to the free **M4A to M4R** converter, select the 'UPLOAD M4A' option to browse your PC for the M4A file that you want to convert.

![Upload M4A file for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2026.png)

****Step 3: Confirm M4R Conversion Format!**

If you're using the **M4A to M4R Converter** you can skip this step. But, if not, make sure that you have chosen 'M4R' as your desired conversion format!

![Confirm M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2027.png)

****Step 4: Convert M4A to M4R!**

With all of that in order, select 'CONVERT' to move forward.

![Convert M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2028.png)

****Step 5: Download Converted M4R!**

Finally, with the conversion done, you can now download the converted file to use as you will! This can be done by selecting the 'DOWNLOAD' option!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2029.png)

### 04**How to Create and How to Open an M4A File?**

If you want detailed instructions on how to create an M4A file, please refer to Part 2, Section 2 of this article, or Part 3, Section 2\. In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the 'Create Version' feature that iTunes offers.

In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!

![iTunes Software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2030.png)

### 05**Which Other Formats M4A Can Be Converted into and Why?**

There are numerous file formats that you can convert M4A into. If you want examples: you can **convert M4A to M4R**, MP3 to M4A, WAV to M4A, FLAC to M4A, OGG to M4A, WMA to M4A, and so much more! Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such **M4A converter** that we recommend is Filmora Pro!

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is an all-in-one video editing software that will allow you to **convert M4A to M4R** (and all sorts of other audio and video file formats) so that you can make use of the file for all your projects!

M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones

As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about **M4R converters** and how to use them.

#### In this article

01 [Why Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Convert M4A to M4R?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Convert MP3 to M4R?**

Let's start with a bit of an overview of M4R and **M4R Converter**s first! We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let's talk about what an **M4R converter** is usually like. Then, let's talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.

### 01**M4R Converter Key Features**

Here's a list of some key features that you should look for in an **M4R Converter**:

**●** Your average **M4R Converter** should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.

**●** It should also allow you to 'extract' audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)

**●** The **M4R** **converter** would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.

**●** A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won't have to undergo the process again and again.

**●** Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.

### 02**Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R**

There are several reasons why you might want to use an **M4R converter** to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:

**●** **Creating iPhone Ringtone**: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you're a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.

**●** **Transfer Ringtones to iPhone**: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!

**●** **Making General M4R Audio**: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.

## Part 2 **How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?**

Now, let's start with a more in-depth tutorial on how to actually convert MP3 to M4R! In this case, specifically, we'll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!

### 01**How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?**

As mentioned, the first **M4R Converter** on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we'll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you're curious, the tool we'll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!**

First! Open the **M4R Converter online** tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:

![Open M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%203.png)

****Step 2: Upload MP3 File**

Next, it's time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!

Usually, all you have to do for this is click the 'Upload' button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the **M4R converter** may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)

![Upload MP3 File for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%204.png)

****Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!**

Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)

![Select M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%205.png)

****Step 4: Select Convert!**

The next thing you need to do is to simply select the 'CONVERT' option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!

![Select Convert Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%206.png)

****Step 5: Download Converter M4R!**

Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click 'DOWNLOAD' and you're done!

### 01**2\. How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?**

Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we'll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple's own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you'll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.

****Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!**

Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to 'File' > 'Add File to Library' or 'Add Folder to Library' to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!

Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the 'FILE' tab (shown in the image below) and then click 'CONVERT' > 'Create Version'!

![Create Version of MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2010.png)

****Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!**

After the conversion has been finished, locate the file's destination folder. You'll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.

Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click 'YES' to confirm the change! In this way, you've managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!

****Step 3: Change M4A to M4R**

With 'File Name Extensions' on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!

Meaning, you can **change M4A to M4R** without worrying about it being unusable!

### 01**2\. How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes**

This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it's important to provide this perspective we'll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!

****Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!**

First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select 'Add File' or 'Add folder' under the 'FILE' tab).

M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones

As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about **M4R converters** and how to use them.

#### In this article

01 [Why Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Convert M4A to M4R?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Convert MP3 to M4R?**

Let's start with a bit of an overview of M4R and **M4R Converter**s first! We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let's talk about what an **M4R converter** is usually like. Then, let's talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.

### 01**M4R Converter Key Features**

Here's a list of some key features that you should look for in an **M4R Converter**:

**●** Your average **M4R Converter** should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.

**●** It should also allow you to 'extract' audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)

**●** The **M4R** **converter** would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.

**●** A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won't have to undergo the process again and again.

**●** Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.

### 02**Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R**

There are several reasons why you might want to use an **M4R converter** to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:

**●** **Creating iPhone Ringtone**: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you're a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.

**●** **Transfer Ringtones to iPhone**: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!

**●** **Making General M4R Audio**: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.

## Part 2 **How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?**

Now, let's start with a more in-depth tutorial on how to actually convert MP3 to M4R! In this case, specifically, we'll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!

### 01**How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?**

As mentioned, the first **M4R Converter** on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we'll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you're curious, the tool we'll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!

****Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!**

First! Open the **M4R Converter online** tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:

![Open M4R Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%203.png)

****Step 2: Upload MP3 File**

Next, it's time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!

Usually, all you have to do for this is click the 'Upload' button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the **M4R converter** may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)

![Upload MP3 File for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%204.png)

****Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!**

Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)

![Select M4R as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%205.png)

****Step 4: Select Convert!**

The next thing you need to do is to simply select the 'CONVERT' option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!

![Select Convert Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%206.png)

****Step 5: Download Converter M4R!**

Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click 'DOWNLOAD' and you're done!

![Download Converted File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%207.png)

### 01**2\. How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?**

Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we'll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple's own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you'll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.

****Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!**

Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to 'File' > 'Add File to Library' or 'Add Folder to Library' to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!

![Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%208.png)

****Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!**

Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you'll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.

This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the 'OPTIONS' tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you'll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!

Click 'OK' when done in order to save any changes!

![Adjust Ringtone Timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%209.png)

****Step 3: Convert to Version!**

Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the 'FILE' tab (shown in the image below) and then click 'CONVERT' > 'Create Version'!

![Create Version of MP3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2010.png)

****Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!**

After the conversion has been finished, locate the file's destination folder. You'll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.

Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click 'YES' to confirm the change! In this way, you've managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!

![Change from M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2011.png)

### 01**3\. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?**

For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we've decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we'll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)

****Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!**

First, launch the **M4R converter** software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we're showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:

![Launch Program and Connect iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2012.png)

****Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker**

Once the program has been launched, go to the 'MUSIC' tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)

![Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2013.png)

****Step 3: Select Music File!**

A secondary window should appear after you select the 'Ringtone Maker' option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.

For the software that we're using as an example, you can choose to upload 'Local Music' from your computer or 'Device Music' from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We'll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!

![Upload Locally or Through Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2014.png)

****Step 4: Local Upload - Open!**

If you select 'Local Music' a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click 'OPEN!'

![Browse Music File Locally](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2015.png)

****Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!**

For the 'Device Music' option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click 'Select' when done!

![Browse Music on Device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2016.png)

****Step 6: TunesGo Library!**

For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the 'MUSIC' tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select 'Ringtone Maker' on the pop-up that appears (shown below).

![Software Library Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2017.png)

****Step 7: Trim and Save!**

Once you've chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:

**●** Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)

**●** Use the 'Ringtone Audition' option to preview your trimmed audio.

**●** And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!

In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!

## Part 3 **How to Convert M4A to M4R?**

Another Apple extension file that you might recognize is M4A! This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as 'compressed' Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It's also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.

### 01**How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?**

This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we'll be going through the easiest method of converting **M4A to M4R** on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.

****Step 1: View File Extensions!**

The first step to **convert M4A to M4R** is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have 'File Name Extensions' selected under the 'VIEW' tab (pointed out in the image below).

This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.

![View File Extensions on Windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2019.png)

****Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!**

Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the 'Rename' option on the pop-up that appears.

![Rename M4A to M4R](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2020.png)

****Step 3: Change M4A to M4R**

With 'File Name Extensions' on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!

Meaning, you can **change M4A to M4R** without worrying about it being unusable!

Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it's selected and then select 'Create Version' for it (the option can be found under the 'FILE' tab > 'Convert'!)

## Free Stock Photos for Commercial Use: Best Websites to Explore

Did you know that some of the world's most iconic advertisements use stock images for commercial use? For example, AlamapBBDO, a Brazilian ad agency, used stock photos from Getty Images to create their [Endless Possibilities campaign](https://thinkmarketingmagazine.com/getty-images-brilliant-campaign-re-create-4-famous-faces-out-of-random-stock-photos/) in 2016\. The advertising campaign combined photos of random people's faces to recreate portraits of famous people such as the Dalai Lama and Pope Francis.

Most creative agencies prefer altering stock images in most of their work. This is because it allows them to create campaigns for different companies much faster at affordable costs. Keep reading to find out how to get free images for commercial use in your next project.

## Part 1: Download images in loyalty-free sites

Several sites offer free images for commercial use as part of their services. In addition, you do not need to register an account to download the images. The sites typically rely on user contributions and content teams to ensure their databases are fresh and maintain consistent quality. Furthermore, all creative assets they offer fall under the creative commons zero license or a variation of it. Here are some of the sites that offer you images for commercial use for free.

### 1\. Pexels

![pexels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-2.jpg)

Pexels.com is a free-to-use provider of high-resolution photos and videos for aspiring creators. The German-based website was started in 2014 by two brothers and has been under the Canva umbrella since 2018.

Currently, the website hosts over 3.2 million images and videos from over 250,000 active contributors. In addition, all the material you find in its library is under the Pexels license, which slightly varies from the creative commons zero license model. Some of the restrictions it enforces include:

* You can only use pexels images for commercial use after making alterations to the original image. For example, you can use part of an image to create a collage for your commercial branding.
* Furthermore, you cannot use any of the website's content to promote political ideologies and explicit content, especially if the images contain identifiable subjects.

Pexels is available through the following channels:

* Your web browser by typing the URL pexels.com.
* The Android and iOS app.
* A plugin for other content creation software such as Google Slides and MS Office.
* An extension on your Chrome browser.
* You can also access the database using the official Canva app.

### 2\. Unsplash

Another website that offers free images for commercial use is Unsplash, a subsidiary of Getty Images since 2021\. The website is a favorite among creators boasting over 16 billion photo impressions monthly. In addition, the database consists of over 3.48 million photos from more than 265,000 unique contributors, all under the Unsplash license.

The Unsplash license restricts the sale of its creative assets without incorporating new creative elements, including using them in print media and physical goods such as mugs and caps.

You can access Unsplash from your web browser or request API integration for your application from the site's owners. In addition, the site also hosts photo walks across different cities, where Unsplash guides show you the best photo locations around the city and the best camera techniques for your work. Some cities to host the event include Boston, Montreal, Tokyo, and Toronto.

### 3\. Freerange

![freerange](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-4.jpg)

Freerange Stock is an online resource for photos, illustrations, and textures you can download and use for commercial and non-commercial purposes. Since 2007, the site has continued to provide high-quality images to its community of over 800,000 registered users.

Unlike the previous examples, all content on Freerange falls under the website's Equalicense. It grants you broad commercial rights of its stock images while allowing the contributors to retain control of their copyright, image resale, and distribution. As such, you cannot use the images for bulk distribution or print-on-demand works.

Freerange Stock maintains its steady supply of images for commercial use via the following methods:

* It has an in-house team of professional photographers who upload images across the different categories on the website.
* Freerange Stock also purchases image rights or directly commissions photos from independent creators.
* You can also contribute to the website's library by voluntarily submitting your work to the platform. Kindly note that you will need a verified account to enable this function.
* The website also works directly with photographers through a licensing and distribution model, providing them extra exposure on the site.
* Finally, Freerange stock aggregates public domain images from other sources, including similar sites and government institutions. It does so by acknowledging the image owner and sometimes lists the image source when the owner is unknown.

Freerange Stock is accessible through your web browser or as an API integration on your app.

### 4\. Vecteezy

![vecteezy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/images-for-commercial-use-5.jpg)

Vecteezy is an extensive online library of free stock images for commercial use. Some of the site's highlight features include the following:

* A best-in-class search engine that incorporates multiple filters to ensure your results are extremely accurate. For example, you can sort images by color, style, number of people, and age of the subjects, something other free stock websites do not provide.
* All images, videos, and vector illustrations are free for personal and commercial uses. It does so through a property sign and release model with its extensive network of contributors, which protects users from any legal liabilities.
* Finally, it employs a content team that manually reviews each photo submission to ensure consistent quality standards for its offerings.

In addition, you can also purchase design resource bundles by subscribing to its Vecteezy pro for as little as $9 monthly. Some of the resources available include the Ultimate Text Effects Layer Styles Bundle for Photoshop, which costs $39 stand-alone or $4.50 when you subscribe to pro.

## Part 2: Buy from stock providers

Another way to get images for commercial use is by buying them from stock providers. Some of the benefits of buying images from stock providers include:

* You get a wide selection of unique photos from top-tier photographers. Stock providers always seek collaborations with the industry's finest to edge out the competition.
* You receive exemplary customer service with your purchase. Selecting the right image can be confusing for amateur creators. As such, stock image providers have customer support channels to help you throughout your creative process.
* Stock images reduce your delivery times significantly. Buying images from a stock provider eliminates the need to invest in photography equipment and the time you need for post-production. As such, you can deliver projects in a fast and cost-effective way.

Despite the above positive, here are some challenges that buying stock images may present:

* Not all stock image providers will have the creative assets you need.
* Image overuse is likely since every creator will rush for the most popular contributor.

Below are some of the stock image providers you should consider.

### 1\. iStock

iStockphoto.com is an online database of creative resources, including royalty-free photos, videos, audio, illustrations, and clip art you can use in your creations. The website is a Getty Images subsidiary based in Calgary, Canada. In addition, contributors earn royalties depending on how often users download their content.

### 2\. Alamy.com

Alamy.com is a British-owned stock image provider with contributions from photographers and agencies in 173 countries. It compensates its contributors by offering higher than average payouts every time users download their creations. Some popular brands to use Alamy's services include M&C Saatchi, Microsoft, and The Economist.

## Part 3: Shot a Photo by yourself or create one with editing tools

Alternatively, you can get images for commercial use by shooting them yourself or creating them with editing tools such as Figma and Wondershare's Filmstock. Here are some benefits of using this method:

* You get exactly what you want, provided you have the required skills and equipment. Sometimes, getting the right image for your commercial purpose can be challenging. As such, shooting an original photo may be the only option.
* You have full ownership of the image.

Unlike obtaining images from stock photography websites, you are free to use the image in whatever capacity you please without any restrictions. For example, sites such as Unsplash do not allow you to use their images in political statements, a restriction you can bypass when using your own creations.

However, you should also consider the following factors when using this method.

### It requires a substantial investment

Getting high-quality images for commercial purposes requires specialist equipment. For example, the Panasonic LUMIX GH6 camera, which has 4K resolution capability, costs $2,197 on Amazon. This makes it extremely expensive for amateur creators.

### There is a steep learning curve

Becoming a professional photographer takes time and effort. Unless you are creating as a hobby, it will be a while before you can start generating income from your creations.

## Part 4: FAQs

### 1\. Do you need a contributor account to get images for commercial use?

Not necessarily. Stock image sites like pexels.com allow you to download images from their website without creating an account. You will only need one if you want to showcase your work on the platform.

### 2\. Can you use your smartphone to get images for commercial use?

Yes. Most stock image providers have device-specific apps that allow you to access their databases from your mobile device. For example, UnsplashPhotoPicker allows you access to the Unsplash library from your Android device.
