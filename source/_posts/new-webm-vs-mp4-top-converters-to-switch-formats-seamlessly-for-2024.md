 Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as well as [online video hosting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and social media platforms.

 WebM, on the other hand, is perfectly suited for videos that are viewed from Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, but only a handful of desktop-based media players offer support for this video file format. That is why in this article we are going to take a look at the 10 best WebM to MP4 converters on the market.

## The 10 Best WebM to MP4 Converters

[Changing the format of a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) file is never a complicated process, regardless of the software or the [web-based application](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you are using. However, the duration, speed, and quality of the conversion process depend on the converter you’ve selected for this task. Here are the ten best WebM to MP4 converters that make the file conversion process swift and smooth.

### 1\. [UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

 This is a powerful file converter that is available both online and on desktop computers. You can choose from more than a thousand conversion formats, which enables you to convert your video files into virtually any format you want.

 So, in order to convert a WebM video to MP4 you just need to add one or more WebM files to UniConverter and then set MP4 as the output file format. The amount of time you will have to wait for the conversion process to be completed varies on the desktop and online versions of UniConverter, and you can only convert two WebM files to MP4 at the same time with the online version of this file converter.

 This is a simple online file conversion tool that lets you convert WebM videos that are stored locally on your computer or on the cloud. You just have to select the source from which you want to import the video, select the output format and decide if you want to change the [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or size.

 When done, simply click on the Convert Now button and then after the conversion process is completed, proceed to download your video to your computer. The only downside is that you cannot convert WebM video files that are larger than 200MB with Aconvert.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.
