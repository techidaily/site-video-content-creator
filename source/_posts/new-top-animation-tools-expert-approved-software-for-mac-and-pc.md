However, you can’t fine-tune the effect’s settings, and some of your photos may not look perfect after you apply a cartoon effect to them. Besides cartooning photos, you can use this platform to perform basic photo editing actions like cropping or rotating, while the platform also offers powerful text tools that enable you to add text layers to photos you cartoon.

Creating cartoons from photos with this platform is a fun process anyone can complete. You just have to upload a photo via URL or from your computer and then proceed to choose one of the available cartoon effects.

You can choose from effects like Cartoon, Toon Cloudy, or Watercolor, and you can just click on the one you like to apply it to your photo. In addition, you can also add text to each photo you cartoonize with the platform and choose a font or the size and color of the text. Moreover, each effect can be adjusted using the Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, and Hue sliders. The only downside is that the platform watermarks all photos you edit with it and you must purchase the PhotoCartoon software in order to remove it.
