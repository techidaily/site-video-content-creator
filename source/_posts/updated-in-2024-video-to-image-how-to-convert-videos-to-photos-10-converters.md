## Part 1: Converting Videos to JPEG and PNG Images with Desktop Video Converters for macOS and Windows

Exporting a single frame of a video clip is an easy task even amateur photo and video editors can perform effortlessly. Mac and PC users have a broad range of options at their disposal if they want to make still images from their videos. Let’s have a look at some of the best video converters you can use to capture still frames and create JPEG or PNG files.

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a video editing software that also offers the option to capture frames of all video clips you use in your projects after you launch the Filmora video editor, import a video file that contains the frames you would like to save as still images.

To extract still images with the original high quality, you can import and place these videos to Project Media and then double-click it to preview. In the preview window, click the Camera icon located in the lower right corner to take a snapshot. It is worth noting that you can only create PNG files with this video editing software, and you may need to change the photo format if PNG isn’t your choice.

![Extract PNG Image from Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-snapchat-9.jpg)

Alternatively, you can use the CTRL+ALT+S keyboard shortcut to take a snapshot of the frame in a video clip. The image you created will be added to the Media tab automatically, and you can proceed to right-click on it and select the Reveal in Explorer option to gain access to the original file.

To extract still image from the video frame by frame, you can add the media asset to the timeline and use the playhead to find the frame you would like to extract from the video. When done, leave the playhead at the location on the timeline where the frame is located, and then click on the Snapshot icon.

### 2\. [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

This is arguably the best photo editing software ever created that grants you access to all the tools you need to manipulate pictures as you see fit. Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.

![Convert Video to Image in Photoshop ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-video-to-image-with-adobe-photoshop.jpg)

The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.

![Render Video to convert to Images in PS ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-video-to-images-photoshop.jpg)

When done, head over to the File menu, and select the Render Video option from the Export submenu. After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

Extracting still frames with VLC media players is a technical process that will require some understanding of the video editing process. Even so, you can still use this open-source software to generate PNG or JPEG files from your videos.

![Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-convert-video-to-image-preference.jpg)

Select the Preferences option from the Tools menu and then click on the Video tab. Make sure that the All option is selected under Show Settings and scroll down until you find the Filters option and expand this menu. Locate the Scene Filter, click on it and then proceed to specify the format in which your images are going to be saved and adjust the Recording Ratio.

Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.

![Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-video-filter-video-to-image.jpg)

Next time you play a video in VLC the media player will automatically capture still frames at the recording ratio you specified.

### 4\. [Free Video to JPEG Converter](https://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-Video-to-JPG-Converter.htm)

If you are looking for a quick and free way to create still images from videos, this Windows-based tool is one of the least complicated options PC users have at their disposal. After you open Free Video to JPEG Converter you just have to click on the Add Files button and import a video from which you would like to extract still frames.

![Free Video to JPEG Converter ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-video-to-jpeg-converter.jpg)

You can then specify the frequency at which frames are going to be extracted and see the total number of frames that are going to be created from your video. Afterward, you just have to specify the location at which the still frames are going to be saved and click on the Convert button.

### 5\. [Virtual Dub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)

Before you can start extracting still frames from videos with Virtual Dub, you must first install the FFMpeg plugin pack because this video converter cannot open common video file formats like MP4 or MOV. Installing this plugin can get a little technical, but it is far from being complicated. Afterward, you just have to launch Virtual Dub and import the video you would like to use to create JPEG files by clicking on the File menu and selecting the Open option.

![ Convert Video to Image Virtual Dub](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-dub-video-to-image-control.jpg)

Select the Frame Rate option from the Video menu and make sure that the checkbox next to the Decimate by setting is selected. Insert the frequency at which still frames are going to be captured into the box next to the Decimate by setting and click on the OK button. Head over to the File menu and select the Image Sequence option from the Export submenu. Before you start extracting still frames from a video you just have to select the file format of the output files, and then wait for Virtual Dub to complete the process.

Here are some of the best web-based platforms you can use to convert videos to JPEG or PNG images.

### 1\. [Online-Convert](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg)

This file conversion platform enables you to convert audio files, documents, and eBooks, but its video to photo conversion options are not the best.

### 2\. [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

This is arguably the best photo editing software ever created that grants you access to all the tools you need to manipulate pictures as you see fit. Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.

![Convert Video to Image in Photoshop ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-video-to-image-with-adobe-photoshop.jpg)

The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.

![Render Video to convert to Images in PS ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-video-to-images-photoshop.jpg)

When done, head over to the File menu, and select the Render Video option from the Export submenu. After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

Extracting still frames with VLC media players is a technical process that will require some understanding of the video editing process. Even so, you can still use this open-source software to generate PNG or JPEG files from your videos.

![Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-convert-video-to-image-preference.jpg)

Select the Preferences option from the Tools menu and then click on the Video tab. Make sure that the All option is selected under Show Settings and scroll down until you find the Filters option and expand this menu. Locate the Scene Filter, click on it and then proceed to specify the format in which your images are going to be saved and adjust the Recording Ratio.

Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.

![Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-video-filter-video-to-image.jpg)

Next time you play a video in VLC the media player will automatically capture still frames at the recording ratio you specified.

### 4\. [Free Video to JPEG Converter](https://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-Video-to-JPG-Converter.htm)

You can then specify the frequency at which frames are going to be extracted and see the total number of frames that are going to be created from your video. Afterward, you just have to specify the location at which the still frames are going to be saved and click on the Convert button.

### 5\. [Virtual Dub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)

Before you can start extracting still frames from videos with Virtual Dub, you must first install the FFMpeg plugin pack because this video converter cannot open common video file formats like MP4 or MOV. Installing this plugin can get a little technical, but it is far from being complicated. Afterward, you just have to launch Virtual Dub and import the video you would like to use to create JPEG files by clicking on the File menu and selecting the Open option.

![ Convert Video to Image Virtual Dub](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-dub-video-to-image-control.jpg)

### 02Are 1920 x 1080 files ok on Instagram?

Nowadays,the most suitable file size on Instagram is 1920\*1080 PX. This is because this size goes well on Instagram stories, reels, IGTV videos, live videos, etc. As per the increased demand, the quality of the videos has also been improved.

### 03The ideal ratio and resolution for Instagram posts

The ideal ratio for Instagram posts is 9:16 and the best resolution is 1080\*1920 PX.

**\***With the correct video settings one can flawlessly post his videos for his followers. Here mentioned are some types of video post that can show you the ideal aspect ratio and best resolution for Instagram:

**❶ Instagram reels**

**●** **Description:** Reels are seen vertically on the mobile phones. Also these are shot using the Instagram application only so you can take the advantage of transitions and effects present within the application to create your reels effectively. The maximum length for Instagram reels must be 60 seconds. Usually the bottom part of these reel videos is for captions and descriptions, so there should be no important information at that place.
