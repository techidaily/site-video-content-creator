## FCPX 2024 Essentials: Synchronizing Audio and Video for Professional Results

# Practical Guide: How to Sync Audio and Video in Final Cut Pro X 2024

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Beautifully captured cinematic footage with crystal clear results and melodious audio attracts viewers and leaves an everlasting impression. However, if there is a delay in the audio and video, you need to sync audio and video clips.

Only an advanced video-editing software like Final Cut Pro X can solve this problem and get everything lined up and cohesive. Its auto-sync feature allows you to adjust audio with video and present your footage realistically and creatively. Similarly, users can create Multicam clips and include multiple clips at any given angle with the FCPX.

Read this beginner’s guide to learn how to sync audio and video and create Multicam clips in the Final Cut Pro X.

> * [Part 3: How to Match Audio and Video Manually in Final Cut Pro X?](#part3)
> * [Part 4: Fast Ways to Sync Multicam in Final Cut Pro X](#part4)

## Part 1: How to Fix Audio and Video Sync Issue?

 **Why is Audio and Video out of Sync in Final Cut Pro X?**

The audio and video out of sync is a common issue faced by most Final Cut Pro X users. They experience an audio delay in their edited video that gives a bad impression and haunts the user experience.

Whenever you face an out-of-sync problem, don’t assume that the clips in your sequence are also out of sync. Multiple factors can cause sync issues, the most prominent one is by an over-taxing of the processor when it tries to run the program at its maximum. Consequently, the overstressed processer fails to sync audio and video accordingly and causes a delay.

![sync-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/sync-audio.png)

If you are experiencing an audio and video sync problem due to an over-taxing of your computer’s processor, follow these steps to relieve processor stress and solve your problem.

* Set the Canvas size to “Fit Window”
* Prevent the Canvas and Viewer from overlapping
* Use an updated, fast, and consistent hard drive that meets the minimum software requirements of Final Cut Pro X
* Set the control panel resolution must be to 75A Hz or higher
* Do not select too many real-time audio tracks
* Turn off the Mirror to Desktop option

## Part 4: Fast Ways to Sync Multicam in Final Cut Pro X

Multicam is an amazing feature of the Final Cut Pro X that allows users to sync a multiple-camera job and manage unlimited video and audio angles. You can make Multicam clips with diverse media sources and include as many clips in any given angle as you want. Make sure you have labeled your clips with a camera name or an angle to make Final Cut Pro X sync Multicam properly. You can even name all the clips shot by one camera in a single step.

Follow these steps to create Multicam clips:

* Create unique folders and put all clips from each camera in these folders separately.
* Go to **Preferences > Import > Keywords** and set the Finder Tags to label the imported clips and set the shots apart from the filenames.
* In the FCPX menu, go to **View > Browser > Toggle Filmstrip/List View** for setting the Event Browser to List View. (You can also use the command OPT+CMD+2).
* If some of your clips have an incorrect time of day, you should adjust them first. Hence, select those clips and click **Modify > Adjust Content Created Date and Time.**
* In the Event Browser, select multiple clips captured with one camera or audio recorder.
* Press CMD+4 to show the Inspector, click the “i” button, and verify the clip’s information like camera name, etc.
* Give a specific camera name to the selected clips and press return and repeat the process for each audio recorder and camera.
* In the Event Browser, select multiple clips that need to be synced. Right-click on these clips and select the “Synchronize Clips” or “New Multicam Clip” option.
* Click the checkbox “Use Audio for Synchronization” to sync audio.

This way, you can sync Multicam using audio in the Final Cut Pro X. To verify or adjust the sync, open the Multicam clip in the Angle Editor and drag it to the left or right. For single-frame adjustment, you can use the comma/period keys, while the left/right angle bracket is used for 10-frame adjustments.

**Conclusion**

Final Cut Pro X is a professional video editing software used by both beginners and experienced photographers to create magic in their videos. Powered by several amazing features and advanced video-editing options, the application features a trackless magnetic timeline and supports compound clips.

Sometimes, an over-taxing of the processor may cause a delay in the video edited by Final Cut Pro X. Hence, the audio and video are out of sync that declines the video quality. To solve this problem, Apple Inc. introduced an auto-sync feature in FCPX which automatically analyzes and synchronizes the audio and video clips. You can also match audio and video manually by selecting any two clips and selecting the Synchronize Clips option.

You may wonder, is there any more way to trim audio? Yes, there is, [click here to see Best Free Online Audio Trimmers to Trim Audio Easily](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Finally, the Multicam feature allows you to make include various clips in your Multicam clip from diverse media sources and manage unlimited video and audio angles.
