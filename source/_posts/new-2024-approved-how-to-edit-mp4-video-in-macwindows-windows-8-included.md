## How to Easily Edit MP4 Video?

Before we proceed to illustrate every detail on how to edit the MP4 video, you can download the MP4 editor first so you can follow the below steps one by one.

It's free to download now.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

####

#### 1. Cut MP4 Video

To cut your MP4 video into certain parts, drag and drop the video on the Timeline and highlight it. Then place the red Time Indicator to where you want to cut the video, and click the Scissor button above the timeline.

After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose "Delete".

![export edited MP4 by cutting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cut-a-section.gif)

####

#### 2. Join MP4 Video

To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit "Create" to export it.

If you want to make the joined videos look like a really intact movie, just add transitions between clips for smooth change from one to next. To do this, click "Transition" tab on the main screen. Then drag the effect you like to the timeline to apply.

If you don't want to choose the transition one by one, let the software choose the transition randomly by right clicking and selecting "Random to All" option.

![edit MP4 files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-transition.JPG)

####

#### 3. Edit the audio of MP4 Video

Sometimes you may need to adjust the settings of audio. To do it, double click the video on the Timeline. Then a editing panel will pop up. Switch to the Audio column and you can easily change the Speed, Volume, Pitch of the audio file or add the Fade in/out effect to it.

Want to change the original audio track of your MP4 video?

No problem.

Just highlight your MP4 video, right click and choose "Audio Detach". The audio file of your video will immediately be separated and appear on the music timeline. Since it is separated from the video, you can easily delete the audio track or replace it with your own music.

Recording in low-light conditions may result in a too gloomy video to see clearly and may potentially degrade video quality.

In such cases, utilizing video brightening software on an iPhone or Android might be one of the greatest ways to brighten a video. In addition, we've compiled a list of **Video Brightening Editor App** programs for you on this page. Carefully read the information below to learn more about their characteristics, supported operating systems, and more!

## Part 1: Best Video Editing Apps to Edit Brightness on iPhone and Android

Brightness is important in a clip, whether you realize it or not. Viewers would not sit through a dark video in which they can't see anything. You need the right amount of brightness in your film to make it more engaging and eye-catching. And the apps we've looked at below can help you do just that.

### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a video brightening editing tool made specifically for cellphones. It's simple to use, and even beginners can use it to edit films. Filmora enhances the video's brightness, making it crisper and more vivid.

This application's features include capturing clips, cutting them, adding background music, applying overlays and effects, and more. This popular program also supports Ultra HD resolution. Filmora includes several powerful tools that enable you to put even the most unique and creative ideas into action.

You may make movies, work on music videos, and share the finished products with your pals. This software saves you time while still providing entertainment!

To brighten a video, simply get the app on your phone and install it. Launch the app and select the "+" button to add the video you wish to modify. By clicking on the 5-second mark in the menu settings, you may alter the video's brightness. Click on the "Export" button to save the altered video for later use.

### 2\. [Capcut](https://www.capcut.net/)

Number second on our list is the Capcut video editor that users have grown absolutely fond of. After testing both the Android and iOS versions of CapCut, we discovered that the software is extremely user-friendly and provides many useful features tailored to TikTok users.

Split-screen, vintage, humorous, dreamy, party, and so on are just a few of the various effects available. Those effects add new components to your video, giving it the appearance of being professionally edited. You'll discover sub-categories of effects inside each of these categories, allowing you to fine-tune your changes to obtain the precise one that's suitable for that clip.

To brighten a video, simply tap on the "+" feature in the new Project tab. Import your video. Head over to the Edit section and apply Brightness from the Adjustment section.

### 3\. iMovie
