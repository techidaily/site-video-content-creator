## Part 1: Getting Filmora for Free via Taking the Mission to Export 3 Videos

Another method is for users who have already installed Filmora on their devices. If you are using Filmora, you do not need to crack it in order to get **Filmora free**. You can earn the Filmora license by doing the mission of exporting three videos in total from the software. The method is quite simple and easy, but the mission is only available for Filmora 10.2 and above versions for a limited time. And the mission may be taken down sometime.

In order to do so, you have to follow the steps mentioned below.

[![Download Filmora X Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora X Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* To begin with, you need to download and install Filmora, and then launch Filmora and then click New Project to create a new project. Then you will see a pop-up window as shown below:

![Filmora mission](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-filmora-for-free-take-mission.jpg)

* The titles tab provides hundreds of titles and texts templates, including openers, titles, Lower 3rds, subtitles, and end credits. You can also use the Plain text template without animations and add some callouts.
* In the next step, add overlays or [transitions in your video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and if you have finished the editing, press Ctrl+S to save the project.

![add transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filters-filmora-win.jpg)

* Finally, click on the "Export" button and select the "Local" tab. Choose a name and file format for your video and tap "Export."

![save your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/go-to-export-panel.jpg)

Log in with your Wondershare ID and click on the "Export" button. Your video will now be exported without a watermark.

## Part 2: Most Easy and Creative Features in Filmora (You Should Definitely Try)

Now you have the **Filmora free** version on your device. That means that you have now successfully gained access to multiple features of Wondershare Filmora for free. Filmora offers its users several unique and creative features that can be used to make your videos top-notch. Mastering these tools requires lots of practice, but the end result is definitely worth it all.

There are various tools offered by Filmora that can help elevate the rank of your videos to make them top-tier, but they are often overlooked. Users generally do not have an idea of how to make the most out of their tool. Here, we have mentioned some of the fun and easy-to-use features offered by Filmora that you should definitely try as an aspiring content creator.

### 1. Filmora Green Screen

The Green Screen effect by Filmora is an advanced feature of the Overlays option. It enables users to combine two overlaid clips in such a way that the background of the lower layer can be visible on the top layer. It uses a color range in the top clip to make it shine through. You can get this effect by using a green background while shooting videos.

[![Download Filmora X Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora X Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Green Screen effect can be used to place subjects over a number of different backgrounds. You can make a green screen on Filmora by simply clicking on the chroma key. It also offers spill removal, color correction, filters, and transition effects to use on your green screen.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2. Filmora Split Screen

The Split Screen feature in Wondershare Filmora allows you to display multiple clips on the screen at the same time. This feature comes in handy when you want to compare different angled shots or add two or more clips to your video. The effect helps users to add a specific style and class into your video.

Filmora currently offers around 30 split screen templates. You can add up to 6 different video clips in these presets at the same time. The default duration of the split screen is 5 seconds, but you can adjust it according to your requirements. You can add all kinds of borders, do a color correction, tuning and apply motion effects on your split-screen.

### 3. Filmora Beat Detection

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** offers a Beat Detection option for users, which marks audio beats from the inserted sound clip in your video automatically. The tool makes it easy to match your edits with the music, allowing a smooth clip. Analyzing and detecting the beats is entirely automatic. Using Filmora, syncing your video to the music is now relatively easy and quick. Even the customization of beat markers doesn't take long. It is an excellent tool for filming, even for people who are first-timers. You can change the highlight beat frequency, offset or add transitions in your beats. This will allow your videos to appear more in-sync and vivid.

#### Conclusion

You can now go on and spread the news. Wondershare Filmora can now be downloaded and used for free without paying any extra money. Using the methods mentioned above, you can get **Filmora free download** on your device without any crack or spending a dollar.
