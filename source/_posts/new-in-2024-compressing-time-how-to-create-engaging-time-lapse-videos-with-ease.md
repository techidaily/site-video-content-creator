![video stabilizer 123 apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/video-stabilizer-123-apps.png)

123 Apps is a favorite website for many creative heads, and the reasons are quite logical. The website is home to a different video, audio, and photo editing tools. So, if you’re talking specifically about what you can do to your videos with 123 Apps, here’s a little glimpse.

* Trimming
* Merging
* Inserting audio and photos into video
* Adding text to video

And, of course, the **free video stabilization.**

Online Video Stabilizer by 123 Apps allows you to remove shakiness from videos shot on any device. So be it a drone, GoPro, iPhone, or an Android, this web-based tool welcomes all.

It’s a free online service with 30+ video codecs ensuring support to all prominent video formats, such as MOV, WEBM, MP4, WMV, AVI, and more.

You can follow these steps to stabilize your shaky video without paying a cent:

**" 1:** Go to the 123 Apps Online Video Stabilizer website. Click on the “Open File” button to upload your video. Depending on the internet speed and video size, the upload might take a few seconds to several minutes. However, you should remember that this platform only allows uploading 700MB of video.

**Step 2:**  After uploading the video, activate the tool and choose the portion of the video that you need to stabilize. Once selected, click the “Play” button to see the results.

**Step 3:**  Next, choose your output video format from the options by selecting the gear icon. By default, the tool is set to MP4 output, so make sure to change it if you want to download the video in your preferred format.

**Step 4:**  Click the “Save” button to export your video to your Mac or Windows OS.

#### 6. [MP4Compress](https://www.mp4compress.com/stabilize-shaky-video-footage/)

![mp4compress](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/mp4compress.png)

Don’"get confused by the name, as this online tool is a gateway to numerous video editing solutions. MP4Compress helps you stabilize shaky footage with ease. Plus, it has many more features to help you make the video look more professional.

For example, the core feature is video conversion to different formats. Likewise, you can compress the videos, make them greyscale, and remove the sound. Contrarily, if you want to stabilize the video through MP4Compress, here’s what you need to do:

**Step 1:** Go to the website, click the “Select file…” button, and choose the video you want that’s troubling you with its shakiness. Keep in mind that you can only upload MP4 files (500MB maximum).

So, if you have a video in other video formats, you will need to convert it into MP4 first.

**Step 2:**  After selecting the video, click the “Upload Video File” button to start the process.

**Step 3:**  Once this tool corrects the shaky video, save it on your computer.

#### 7. [Stabilizo](https://www.stabilizo.com/)

![stabilizo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/stabilizo.png)

Stabilizo is another pick to stabilize shaky videos online for free. While the software also offers other services like a PDF converter and video compressor, the tool is famous for stabilizing videos recorded on different devices.

Usually, it takes a few minutes to work on the video, but it depends on the size of your footage and internet speed. If the video is recorded at a high resolution or you have slow internet, Stabilizo might take more than 5 minutes to do the job.

This is how the tool works:

**Step 1:** Go to the website and click the “Browse” button to select the video you want to stabilize.

**Step 2:** Click the “Upload Video” button to upload the video (500MB max) on the tool and wait until the software stabilizes the video.

**Step 3:** Once it’s completed, click the “Download File” button to save the video on your computer.

#### 8. [VideoUtils](https://www.stabilizo.com/)

![videoutils](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/videoutils.png)

VideoUtils is a complete pack of great tools for online video editing. You can rely on this free web-based program for audio, image, video, and even PDF editing. Nevertheless, you can simply check the “Video Stabilizer” tool to correct the shakiness you’ve got in your video during recording.

It has a simple interface and is also a bit familiar with previous video stabilizing tools mentioned in this list. But unlike most, this online stabilizer supports various video formats, such as AVI, MOV, MP4, WEBM, and MKV.
