##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Post-production always takes time regardless of how large or small your project is, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start promoting your movie before you complete it. In fact, filmmakers have been using movie trailers for years to inform the audience about their upcoming projects.

There is no need to spend money on a movie trailer maker since the video editing software you’re using to edit the footage can also be used to create trailers for videos you are working on. Even so, there are so many different video editing software products for Macs and PCs, that finding the one that is best suited for your video editing needs can be difficult. That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.

## Best Movie Trailer Software for PC and Mac Computers

Mastering a short video form like a movie trailer takes a lot of practice, as you only have a limited amount of time to tell your story. Each of the video editing software products we featured in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need to tell your stories, but it is up to you which ones you are going to use to make your next movie trailer. So, let’s take a look at what best movie trailer makers for Mac and PC have to offer.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS, iOS

Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers. Besides offering basic video editing tools that enable you to edit your footage quickly, iMovie also features a collection of trailer templates. So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.

None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.

Want to know the details? Check the detailed guide about [how to make a movie trailer with iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are searching for a video editing software that allows you to perform almost any video editing task with ease, then Filmora may be a good option for you. This video editor for Macs and PCs has everything you are going to need to make a movie trailer, since importing the footage into a project requires you to simply drag and drop a video file you want to use in your trailer from a folder to the editor’s media bin.

![ Filmora9 Movie Trailer maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-make-movie-trailer.jpg)

In addition, Filmora offers hundreds of transitions, openers and end credits templates, which speeds up the video editing process significantly. The visual effects library contains a broad range of image filters and overlays, and you can export all projects directly from Filmora to your account on Vimeo or YouTube.

### 3\. [VSDC Free Video Editor](http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

You won’t need much time to get used to VSDC’s interface even if you don’t have any previous video editing experience. The video editor supports nearly all popular video file formats, and at the moment it is the only free video editing software that allows you to export 4K videos without watermarks. Moreover, making a movie trailer with VSDC is remarkably easy, as you just have to arrange the footage on the timeline, apply visual effects and create an opener and the end credits. The software doesn’t offer templates, which means that you have to go through this process manually. VSDC lets you choose from a variety of export profiles that optimize your movie trailers for playback on Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms. What’s more, the software enables you to upload projects directly to YouTube, which can save you a lot of time on rendering movie trailers.

### 4\. [Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

**Price:** $299 - 599

**Compatibility:** Windows

Film industry professionals don’t need a special introduction to Vegas Pro since this video editing software was and still is one of the best video editors for Windows ever created. That is why it is hardly a surprise that you can use Vegas Pro for much more than just making movie trailers. In fact, it is hard to imagine a video editing task you cannot perform with this video editing software. Vegas Pro lets you edit and export projects in resolutions that go as high as 8K, while it also provides a broad range of advanced video editing options, such as complete HDR support or planar motion tracking. In addition, Vegas Pro is compatible with Boris FX, AutoLooks OFX and numerous other plug-ins that enable you to create professional-looking movie trailers.

### 5\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20.99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Premiere Pro is arguably the most famous video editing software of all time that is frequently used to create movie trailers or entire full-feature movies. The software supports all video file formats, even those created by professional video cameras like Red Dragon or Arri Alexa. Adding and arranging video clips on the timeline won’t take too much effort, and you can also apply transitions between shots, or perform color correction in the software’s Lumetri panel. Adobe Premiere Pro features an impressive collection of visual effects, and all projects you create with this video editor can be opened in Adobe After Effects where you can create Hollywood-like visual effects for your movie trailers. However, you’re going to need advanced video editing skills in order to create a movie trailer for the project you’re working on in Adobe Premiere Pro.

### 6\. [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

**Price:** Free trial available, $299.99

**Compatibility:** macOS

No Country for Old Men, Cold Mountain or The Curious Case of Benjamin Button are just a few among countless blockbuster movies edited on Final Cut Pro X. So, it is hardly a surprise that this iconic video editing software is one of the best movie trailer makers for Mac computers on the market. The video editor allows you to have complete control over each step of the movie trailer making process and enables you to make openers, apply a visual effect, create soundtracks and much more. Sadly, Final Cut Pro X doesn’t offer movie trailer templates, although you can save all your projects, which enables you to create your own movie trailer templates. In case you don’t have a lot of video editing experience, it is better to opt for a movie trailer maker that doesn’t require you to have an advanced set of video editing skills.

### 7\. [Avid Media Composer](https://www.avid.com/media-composer)

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $23.99

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Even though Avid Media Composer isn’t the most famous video editing software we included in this article, the features it offers stand shoulder to shoulder with those provided by Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro X. Both free and paid versions of Avid Media Composer are aimed at professional video editors, while some of the subscription plans are best suited for large media houses that have large teams working on the same project. Unsurprisingly, this video editing software is compatible with a broad range of audio and video plugins that extend its capabilities even further. Making a movie trailer with Avid Media Composer isn’t a task for an inexperienced video editor, but seasoned film industry professionals are going to have a lot of fun creating movie trailers with this video editing software.

### 8\. [HitFilm Pro](https://fxhome.com/hitfilm-pro)

**Price:** Pricing options start at $390.00

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

The seemingly never-ending list of video editing features this software offers includes compositing and layering options, 3D camera projection or Behavior effects to mention a few.

Nonetheless, this video editing software is only suitable for industry professionals with years of experience.

## Video Editing Tips to Help you Make Better Movie Trailers

Making a movie trailer is an art, since telling a story of an entire movie in just a few minutes is never easy. Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.

### 1\. Don’t Reveal Too Much

A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. That’s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audience’s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.

### 2\. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text

Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isn’t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.

### 3\. Make a Soundtrack

Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldn’t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailer’s soundtrack.

**Conclusion**

The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software you’re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project. Which movie trailer maker are you going to choose? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

Post-production always takes time regardless of how large or small your project is, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start promoting your movie before you complete it. In fact, filmmakers have been using movie trailers for years to inform the audience about their upcoming projects.

There is no need to spend money on a movie trailer maker since the video editing software you’re using to edit the footage can also be used to create trailers for videos you are working on. Even so, there are so many different video editing software products for Macs and PCs, that finding the one that is best suited for your video editing needs can be difficult. That is why in this article we are going to take you through the ten best trailer makers for Mac and Windows operating systems.

## Best Movie Trailer Software for PC and Mac Computers

Mastering a short video form like a movie trailer takes a lot of practice, as you only have a limited amount of time to tell your story. Each of the video editing software products we featured in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need to tell your stories, but it is up to you which ones you are going to use to make your next movie trailer. So, let’s take a look at what best movie trailer makers for Mac and PC have to offer.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

**Compatibility:** macOS, iOS

Mac, iPhone and iPad users have a free and easy solution at their disposal if they want to make movie trailers.

So, all you need to do in order to make a movie trailer is to add the video clips and insert the title of the movie, the director’s name and create the end credits.

None of the movie trailer templates you can find in iMovie allow you to add music to them, although you can create the soundtrack for your trailer from iMovie’s Movie mode. Furthermore, the templates can limit the maximum duration of your trailer, which is why you must make sure that the video clips you want to use match the duration of the trailer you selected.

## Video Editing Tips to Help you Make Better Movie Trailers

Making a movie trailer is an art, since telling a story of an entire movie in just a few minutes is never easy. Even though most Hollywood trailers look alike, there is no fixed recipe you have to follow while making a movie trailer for your project. However, there a few guidelines that can help you convey the core messages of your movie to the audience.

### 1\. Don’t Reveal Too Much

A movie trailer only needs to suggest what the movie is about, not tell its entire story. That’s why adopting the Less is More rule can be quite helpful during the process of making a movie trailer. Show just enough to spark the audience’s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.

### 2\. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text

Show just enough to spark the audience’s curiosity, because if you reveal too much they might feel as if they have already seen the best parts of your movie.

### 2\. Find Creative Ways to Use Narration and Text

Giving the audience all the information they need solely through images isn’t always possible, which is the reason why nearly all movie trailers have a narrator. Recording a voiceover and using text to convey the information about the movie to the audience will make the trailer more informative and a better promotional tool.

### 3\. Make a Soundtrack

Sound can give rhythm to a movie trailer, but it can also build suspense or suggest that something horrible is about to happen, which is why you shouldn’t hesitate to add audio effects or music to movie trailers you are making. The sound effects and the music must match the video perfectly in order for your trailer to be effective, which is the reason why you should dedicate special attention to the trailer’s soundtrack.

**Conclusion**

The key concepts of making a movie trailer are always the same, regardless of the video editing software you’re using. Each movie trailer maker we featured in this article offers more than enough video editing tools to make a dynamic and captivating movie trailer, but how you are going to use these tools entirely depends on the demands of your project. Which movie trailer maker are you going to choose? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)

* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.

We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

Since uploading 4K videos to online video converters may take much time, so in this article, we will share some of the best 4K video converters that allow you to convert 4K to 1080P resolution or other resolutions in MP4, MOV, MKV or other formats easily on Windows and Mac only.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.

We have been familiar with 1080p resolution for quite some years. However, HD has taken a new leap with ‘4k UHD’ offering higher than 1080p resolution. 4k UHD is mainly used in digital cinema with 4096x2160 as its pixel resolution or Ultra HD television with 3840× 2160 as its resolution. And we’ve compared 4K and 1080P before, and you can check the difference and get a clue [why 4K is better than 1080P](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The 4k technology allows the users to enjoy a very detailed screen of movies and videos which was not possible before. Though there are some 4K devices just as what we have rated before such as [4K TV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K smartphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [4K monitor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and[4K camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) nowadays, 4k being relatively new, not all people have access to 4K devices and sometimes, and there are rather limited options to play 4K videos in a [4k video player](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). 4k being relatively new, there are not many devices that support 4k and rather limited options to play these videos in a 4k video player.

Since uploading 4K videos to online video converters may take much time, so in this article, we will share some of the best 4K video converters that allow you to convert 4K to 1080P resolution or other resolutions in MP4, MOV, MKV or other formats easily on Windows and Mac only.

While we’ve updated the list of best 4K video converters and add some more Video Converters that support 4K resolution. Both of them support Windows and Mac versions, and some of them are totally free to use while others may need to pay to convert 4K video footage.

### 4k vs 1080p

It is understood that 4k is much better than 1080p but the real question is, can you see the difference between 4k and 1080p?

**Can people say for sure that’s 4k and that’s 1080p?**

The answer is **Yes**, that there is no significant difference in both resolutions but while using a 65 inches screen the difference becomes clear, and as you go up in the sizes it gets more prominent.

![4kvs1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4kvs1080.png)

Still, there are some pros and cons to both resolutions.

So do not wait…

Let us dive into the detail:

### What is a 4k?

As its name implies, it has almost 4000 pixels where it has **3840 x 2160px** or **4096 x 2160** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. 4k presents clear and sharp graphics who loves to watch clear picture quality. It is commonly used in theaters and movies but it has also become common in residential use these days.

![4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/4k.png)

**Pros**

* When it comes to resolution 4k is always a better choice as it has 4 times more data than 1080p which means it has good picture quality. Its pixels are much smaller and it provides detailed information about the picture.
* It allows you to crop and scale without pixelating your video.
* It can be downscaled. Downscaling means converting the video to a low resolution and still achieving better video quality.
* If you are a professional video editor, you can charge more for 4k videos.  
**Cons**
* It occupies more space on your camera.
* It is harder to record.
* It takes up a big space in memory so it is harder to edit.
* There is limited content for 4k videos.  

### What is a1080p?  

As its name implies, it has almost 1000 pixels where it has **1920 x 1080px** horizontally and vertically and **16:9** is the Resolution. It is also known as Full HD or FHD.  
![1080](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/1080.png)  
**Pros**

* You can edit and shoot your videos on an average laptop or camera even you can use your cell phone.
* It is most preferable in shooting slow-motion videos.
* It has better features in terms of FPS (frame rate per second).
* It has a much better focus than 4k.
* Most people use 1080p laptops and devices and 4k video would also be converted into 1080p.
* 1080p is more economical if you have a low budget. **Cons**
* Its pixels are not too small and the images are not sharper.
* It gives a little low-quality video or image. The picture quality beats resolution.
* You cannot scale and crop your video as it will ruin your video. You can see the result in the screenshot below.  
![scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/scale.png)  
In the picture above, you can clearly observe that the 4k image has sharp results around the edges of the image and written text. Hence it is clearer than 1080p.

And, of course, video rotation is as easy as ABC! You can follow this step-by-step tutorial to rotate or flip your videos using Filmora 10\. You can apply the same procedure if you have a different version.

**Step 1: Download and Install Filmora**

Visit Filmora Video Editor's [official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to download the newest version. Click on the “Try it Free” button according to your operating system (look at the icons on the button to identify the OS).

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-1.jpg)

After downloading the setup, double-click the file to install the video editor. Then, open the program.

Feel free to judge the interface (see the image below), as it is pretty simple to understand. So, even if you’re a beginner, you can learn this tool within a few minutes of practice.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-2.jpg)

**Step 2: Import the Video You Want to Rotate**

The next is to bring the video file to Filmora’s library before proceeding. To do that, click on the “Movie Clip” icon in the center of the interface to select the clip from your computer’s hard drive.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-3.jpg)

Double-click or select the video and click the “Open” button to import files. The importing process may take several seconds or a few minutes, depending on the video size.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-4.jpg)

If you’re using Filmora for the first time, you might see the “Create Proxy File” message popping up right after the video import. So, simply click on the “Yes” button to go ahead.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-5.jpg)

Your video will be stored in the “Project Media” tab and will be visible next to the preview window.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-13.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-14.jpg)

Now, click the “OK” button to apply rotation and return to the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-15.jpg)

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-13.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-14.jpg)

Now, click the “OK” button to apply rotation and return to the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-15.jpg)

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)

Rename your file and click on the “Save” button.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-17.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-3.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-4.jpg)

If you’re using Filmora for the first time, you might see the “Create Proxy File” message popping up right after the video import. So, simply click on the “Yes” button to go ahead.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-5.jpg)

Your video will be stored in the “Project Media” tab and will be visible next to the preview window.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-13.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-14.jpg)

Now, click the “OK” button to apply rotation and return to the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-15.jpg)

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)
