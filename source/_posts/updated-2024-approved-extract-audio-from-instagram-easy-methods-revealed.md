## Importing

There are two main ways to import media into Premiere, the import command and the media browser. They do things slightly differently and have uses they are both best suited to, here we will look at the process itself and which method to use in a given situation.

#### 1\.  Import Command

This is a straightforward command that works like most other programs, and is accessed from the file menu, or via the Control+I shortcut on the PC or Command+I on the Mac. You can also double click an empty area of the project panel to automatically open the import dialogue.

Whichever way you access it, you get the standard for the platform import dialogue box we see here.

![Import videos to Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-1.jpg)

This method of importing is best suited to self-contained media such as audio or graphics, or video files such as MP4 that are single files themselves, whose location on your computer you know so you can navigate to them easily. This is not the way to import videos from cameras, as they invariably create complex file and folder arrangements that make choosing the correct files difficult. This is where you would opt for the media browser method instead.

#### 2\.  Media Browser

Whilst on the surface media browser appears to do the same job as the import command the way they carry out the task is somewhat different, media browser is designed to let you see the media created by cameras, and show you easy to understand icons and metadata rather than the intricate pattern of files and folders they use. This makes picking the correct clip from a selection much easier, with metadata showing you date and duration as well as file type.

![Import videos to Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-2.jpg)

The media browser panel is found in the project panel, which on the standard layout is the bottom left corner, and can also be accessed by the Shift+8 shortcut. As you can see from the screenshot it works like an operating system file browser and allows you to navigate through the file directories of hard drives and removable media connected to the system.

One of the benefits of media browser is to narrow down the type of media being shown, so you can set to avchd for instance and it will display just that type of file in a given location. Because many projects use media from different sources this can be a real boon to finding the right file within a list.

#### File Types

Media browser displays more or less any file there is in a given location, and importing is simply a matter of selecting the correct file and double clicking it or right clicking and selecting import from the menu. You can select multiple files at once by holding down shift and import them all together if needed.

There are some exceptions to this, however, despite having a huge number of file types supported natively within Premiere, you will sometimes run into files that are not supported, FLV and MKV files being the most common ones, but this is not the end of the world and there is a simple solution.

[Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) offers an easy way to convert any file you may have into media that Premiere can use quickly and efficiently, and is a great tool to have alongside premiere if you commonly work with multiple file types.

## Exporting

The ultimate aim of any project is obviously to finish it and let others see the result of your creativity, and that means exporting your work into a format that is suitable for the medium you wish the project to be viewed on. Premiere offers a number of options regarding export, you can select an entire sequence to export as a single file for the web or disc, choose a single frame to post to a website, blog or to distribute through email, you can export just the audio, or just the video from a sequence, and if you have the right hardware, can export directly to tape or disk.

To export a project that closely matches the original media in quality and frame rates, often called a master copy, is very straightforward in Premiere, with the sequence selected, either in the Timeline Panel or the Project Panel, you simply use the File > Export > Media path :

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-3.jpg)

Which opens the media export dialogue.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-4.jpg)

Selecting 'Match Sequence Settings' here creates a finished file that matches the quality of the original source media. Then you simply choose a suitable name for the file in the Output Name field, and click export. This creates in essence a digital clone of the sequence, and best practice is to always do this for any project, however, for many projects, this is not necessarily the format you would want the final product to be in, those concentrating on YouTube output, or someone wanting to author a DVD for instance will need other options.

Thankfully Premiere caters here as well. Instead of selecting the 'Match Sequence Settings' within export dialogue, you can click on the 'Format' field to change the type of file that is produced. What options here can vary depending on codecs installed, this screenshot shows only those that are included with the product for clarity.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-5.jpg)

Depending on which format you choose. The preset below will allow you to choose a wide range of output settings to suit the intended platform. For instance, selecting  format brings up a huge number of presets for various Tablets and Phones, but also for Vimeo and YouTube, which is why it is one of the most common output formats. Here's a look at some of the presets available from the menu.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-6.jpg)

Once you choose a preset, you can further modify the parameters to suit the project you are working on and even save those as an additional custom preset for later projects should you wish. Again, choosing a suitable file name and clicking Export ends the process.

The other common requirement is for DVD or Blu-Ray files. Whilst you need access to the appropriate hardware to burn the disk, Premiere creates the file structure for that natively and you have two options here. Mpeg2 in either DVD or Blu-Ray form, or  Blu-Ray. With high quality source material, the two formats are virtually indistinguishable in their final format, however, MPEG2 will be much quicker to render and is a good choice for most applications. Although  does allow more content to fit into a given space, so it does have uses. Importing and exporting are the foundation of Premiere use, and as we have shown Premiere makes it very easy to do and produces the right file types for whatever your project is to be used for.

With the addition of [Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) you have a workflow that can ingest and export any type of media file you will ever come across with the minimum of fuss.

## Importing

There are two main ways to import media into Premiere, the import command and the media browser. They do things slightly differently and have uses they are both best suited to, here we will look at the process itself and which method to use in a given situation.

#### 1\.  Import Command

This is a straightforward command that works like most other programs, and is accessed from the file menu, or via the Control+I shortcut on the PC or Command+I on the Mac. You can also double click an empty area of the project panel to automatically open the import dialogue.

Whichever way you access it, you get the standard for the platform import dialogue box we see here.

![Import videos to Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-1.jpg)

This method of importing is best suited to self-contained media such as audio or graphics, or video files such as MP4 that are single files themselves, whose location on your computer you know so you can navigate to them easily. This is not the way to import videos from cameras, as they invariably create complex file and folder arrangements that make choosing the correct files difficult. This is where you would opt for the media browser method instead.

#### 2\.  Media Browser

Whilst on the surface media browser appears to do the same job as the import command the way they carry out the task is somewhat different, media browser is designed to let you see the media created by cameras, and show you easy to understand icons and metadata rather than the intricate pattern of files and folders they use. This makes picking the correct clip from a selection much easier, with metadata showing you date and duration as well as file type.

![Import videos to Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-2.jpg)

The media browser panel is found in the project panel, which on the standard layout is the bottom left corner, and can also be accessed by the Shift+8 shortcut. As you can see from the screenshot it works like an operating system file browser and allows you to navigate through the file directories of hard drives and removable media connected to the system.

One of the benefits of media browser is to narrow down the type of media being shown, so you can set to avchd for instance and it will display just that type of file in a given location. Because many projects use media from different sources this can be a real boon to finding the right file within a list.

#### File Types

Media browser displays more or less any file there is in a given location, and importing is simply a matter of selecting the correct file and double clicking it or right clicking and selecting import from the menu. You can select multiple files at once by holding down shift and import them all together if needed.

## Understanding HD Video Resolution: A Step-by-Step Guide

##### Versatile Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora

An easy yet powerful editor

Numerous effects to choose from

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

#### In this article

01 [What is HD Video?](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?](#Part 2)

03 [Video Resolution and Corresponding File Sizes?](#Part 3)

04 [Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?](#Part 4)

05 [Is HD 2K or 1K?](#Part 5)

06 [How to Change Video Resolution Easily?](#Part 6)

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

## Part 1 What is OGG?

### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 03How to Play OGG Files?

When you are looking forward to playing the OGG files, it is important to convert them. Most devices available do not support the file format, due to which you cannot play them directly. Maybe the operating system at which you are using the device may support it but if it is not, look out for converter tools.

### 04Which Other Formats OGG Can Be Converted into and Why

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.
