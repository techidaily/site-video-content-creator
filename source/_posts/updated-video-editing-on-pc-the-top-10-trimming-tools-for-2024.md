## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.
