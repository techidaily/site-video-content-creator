It’s very common that you filmed some amazing portrait or landscape videos but in the wrong direction. This is an error made by many people because not everyone will always think about orientation when filming. Is there an easy way to flip/rotate videos so that you can watch them without turning your head sideways?

What you need is just an ease to use video editor like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to flip/rotate your video clips easily and quickly. This application offers a remarkably easy way to flip videos clockwise or anticlockwise, horizontal or vertical. What’s more, this flip software also offers a broad range of video editing features, effects and intro/credits.

In the following, I’ll describe how to flip a video in Windows using this video flip program. If you’re a Mac user, just adopt Wondershare Filmora X for Mac (Latest Filmora version X for Mac) to achieve the same.

First, please download Filmora X for free as per your operating system, and then follow the steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1. Import Your Original Video Clips

After launching Filmora X, click "New Project" to begin. Click "Import" to browse your file folder on computer or drag the video clips directly into the media library.

When you import all of them, click the thumbnails showing in the left pane to preview in the right screen window.

Note that this video editor supports an array of video & audio formats, such as MOV, MP4, AVI, WMV, DV, avchd (MTS, M2TS). And still image files like JPG, BMP, JPEG, PNG. TIFF are all fully compatible.

And then drag your video files from media library to the video Timeline.

#### 2. Flip the Whole Video

Then double click the video in the timeline to access the editing panel. In the window that appears, switch to Video tab and you will find Transform option located on the top.

Click on the Transform to expand the four options including Rotate, Flip, Scale and Position. To get the effect you need, you can adjust the Rotate and Flip settings and check the real-time effect in the previewing window. Though only four buttons available, you can create more options by using them together.

* **Rotate:** rotate video at any angle by entering the angle value or moving the Rotate slide: rotate 90° clockwise & anti-clockwise, rotate at 180°, rotate 270°, and more
* **Flip:** Flip video horizontally, i.e. flip video left to right; flip video vertically that is fliping video upside down
* You can combine Rotate and Flip feature to flip video vertically and rotate 90°clockwise or flip video vertically and rotate 90°counterclockwise.

Besides, you can also change the video position and the video scale. This is the step of flips the whole part of the video.

#### 3. Flip Only a Part of the Video

Sometimes, you may just need to flip parts of your video file, e.g. only 1 minute instead of the whole video. In this case, you need to [split your video into separate files](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and then repeat step 2 to flip them individually.

To do it, just move the playhead to the position you want to split, and click the "Scissors" icon in the menu bar.

You may also want to upload your creation to YouTube or burn to DVD disc for better preservation, just go for it. Finally, click Export to let this video flip program perform the rest.

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## But why would someone want to convert a video to a GIF, to begin with? There are several explanations for this

### GIFs are inexpensive

When converting a video to a GIF, you're repurposing existing material to create something new. Why not get the most out of your video marketing strategy?

### GIFs are simple to create

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

The staggering amounts of video content on the Internet are making it difficult to attract the attention of the audience you are targeting. Summarizing the highlights of your video in a short twenty to thirty-second trailer is one of the techniques you can use to spark the audience’s attention and ultimately increase the number of views your videos are getting.

Besides the promotional purposes, you can also use trailers to create entertaining short videos in order to have fun with your friends. Fortunately, you don’t need a [professional video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) suite to perform this task since there are hundreds of [video editing apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allow you **to create trailers on iPhones and iPads.**

Selecting the footage you are going to include in the trailer you are making, is probably the most difficult part of the process, since most movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads offer customizable templates.

iMovie offers a variety of predesigned trailer themes, so you just have to pick the one you like the most and then choose the footage you want to include in your trailer. Keep in mind that you cannot add music to any of the trailer themes, but you can export the trailer you created and create the soundtrack from iMovie’s Video mode. What’s more, you can also use this app to [add transitions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), visual effects or [titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to the trailers you create with iMovie.
