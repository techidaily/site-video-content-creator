**Step 1: Create a fresh project and import media files**

Launch the Final Cut Pro X app, and once opened, create a new project by executing "File > New > Project". Type the name of your project or video, and press "**OK**".

Now, you can start to import the video file to add the jump cuts.

**Step 2: Add markers**

Bring the video into the timeline, and play the video. To add markers before creating jump cuts on the timeline, bring the pointer to the clip where you need to divide it into segments and press "**M**".

A blue marker will be on the video timeline. Similarly, you can place markers on places wherever required.

**Step 3: Apply jump cuts**

Lastly, to apply quick jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro, tap the speed icon from the timeline where you will get various options from which you need to click the “**Jump Cuts at Markers**” option.

You can specify the frame range based on which the jump cuts will get executed in the video.

Thus, this is **how to do jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro** by speeding up the clips based on frames hence helping the action happen in just a fraction of seconds.

## Part 2: How to Fix a Jump Cut in Final Cut Pro X?

If you do jump cuts with markers in FCPX, you do not need to fix it, but if you opt for the other way of cut and delete, you must set them for a smoother process. Let's take a look at **how to fix a jump cut** by transition addition.

**Step 1**. After importing your media files, perform jump cuts by following the previous section.

**Step 2**. To fix jump cuts, place the pointer on the clip, and tap the transition icon from the timeline menu with various options. Primarily "**Flow**" transition option is used in FCPX.

Tap any option, and Final Cut Pro X will automatically apply it to the clip.

## Part 3: How to Hide Jump Cuts in Final Cut Pro X?

Want to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X? Then, here is the session to know **how to hide jump cuts** in FCPX with two options: resizing the video clip and synchronizing clips.

**Method 1: Resizing the clip**

To do this method, select a clip. It could be the first one or the latter. Now, click on the “Resize” icon.

You can resize the clip using the circle resize option near the video preview or the “Scale” option on the right corner.

Doing so will add effects to the video clip hiding the jump cuts added.

**Method 2: Synchronizing clips**

Another way to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X is to synchronize the clip with the other relevant clip.

You can add another video to the timeline and place it where you created the jump cut.

When you prefer this method, you have to ensure that the synchronized video's audio is on mute to avoid disturbing the actual one.

## Conclusion

After going through this blog, we know and hope you have now found how well Final Cut Pro X can help you create a **jump cut like a pro**. Yes, guys, are you in awe to find that your FCPX can do wonders? While many more functionalities are still under the carpet, I believe you would find out today's article on **how to do jump cuts in Final Cut Pro** quite helpful. Want to make quick jump cuts?
