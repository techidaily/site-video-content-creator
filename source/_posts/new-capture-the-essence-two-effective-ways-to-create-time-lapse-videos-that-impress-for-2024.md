## Part 3: Tips for Creating Highlight Video

There are many times you want to create an epic highlight reel. Here are few tips to help you create exciting and entertaining highlight reels.

**Learn the event timeline**

When you want to create a highlight video for any event, whether official or personal, study the event schedule beforehand. For instance, when filming a wedding, know when the bride will arrive when the couple exchanges rings and vows. If your highlight video is about a conference, it is essential to know when speakers will deliver the speech, etc.

**Make a list of shots**

Next, have a list of parts that you wish to capture so that you are more organized at the event. You can’t predict each moment but being ready will help you capture memorable moments.

**Use the right equipment**

You need to use proper equipment for the events to ensure the footage looks great in low light. Gather all your equipment before the event and make sure it is fully charged and functional. Carry the extra batteries and other tools as well.

As we use our mobile phones for producing and watching videos more and more every year, the demand for advanced options is constantly on the rise. Split screen is one of such options that users expect from their video apps nowadays, and products that include it stand a better chance to gain a steady foothold in the market. As a response, many new video tools equipped with the [split screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are being launched, but not all of them offer the same level of technical quality and user experience.

To help you differentiate between the competing apps and select the one that works best for you, we prepared an overview of the best split screen video apps for iOS and Android you can use to record, create, and share great-looking multimedia with minimal effort.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

This is Apple’s own video app and it is generally regarded as one of the better in its class, especially considering it’s free to download. The app allows users to shoot, edit, and publish their videos and basically acts as a full-scale portable production studio capable of creating professional-looking movie trailers or even short films. Among the numerous advanced features, iMovie supports split-screen and picture-in-picture options, while also making it very simple to add titles or credits in a wide variety of styles. Because of this, it can be sufficient for anyone whose editing needs are not too complex. Even professional users can start working in iMovie before switching to a more robust Apple editing tool such as Final Cut Pro X.

### 2\. [PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&hl=en)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - PicPlayPost ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-movie-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile tool can be used to create and edit video clips or photo collages with a broad range of eye-catching features. It supports the split screen option with up to 9 tiles organized in a 3 x 3 pattern, and offers a lot of pre-defined backgrounds and layouts. Most importantly, you can choose between 9:16 and 16:9 aspect ratios, so the outgoing clips are ready for sharing on any social media platform in landscape or portrait orientation. It’s perfect for creating simple side-by-side comparisons as well as more complex collages that consist of still photos, GIFs, and video clips. The app is easy to use and requires very little training to achieve spectacular results.

### 3\. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-collage-and-photo-grid/id779353036)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Collage and Photo Grid ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

The advantage of any specialized app is that it can perform the chosen function very well, and in the case of a video collage app that means a lot of split screen presets and customization opportunities. You can choose from 64 different layouts featuring up to four videos that can play at the same time. All layouts can be manually adjusted to get the best possible fit with your content, while frame textures can be changed as well. The resulting video collage can be combined with music for a true multimedia feel. Instant preview is a very useful feature as well since it allows the authors to experiment freely while they are searching for the perfect layout of the screen.

### 4\. [Split Screen Video](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-screen-videos/id1141913470#?platform=iphone)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** $2.99

![Split Screen Video Making App -Split Screen Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-videos-app.jpg)

With this simple digital tool, you can easily combine from two to four videos into a great, dynamic clip. This is an Apple-only application and has a modest price considering the range of its features. Videos can be placed into frames, and their size and style can be adjusted at will so that some tiles are larger than others. For those who enjoy speed and convenience, there are six preset layouts that can be used to quickly put together a stunning split screen video. Since the interface is extremely user-friendly, this can take as little as a few minutes to execute.

### 5\. [Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perfect-video-editor-collage/id633335631)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-video-editor-collage.jpg)

There are numerous advantages of this split screen video app, starting from the simplicity of use that makes it ideal for beginners and casual users. Perfect Video Editor supports practically every aspect ratio you can think of, so it works well as a universal editing tool regardless of the intended use of the video. The split screen feature is sadly limited to just two video channels, somewhat limiting the range of options at your disposal. Picture and picture and chroma key features can partially make up for this limitation, along with animated subtitles and great transitions that add some extra oomph to the final product.

### 6 [Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

You can do a lot of different things with this video editing app, although it’s best suited for the creation of Instagram videos. The free version is available for both major OS platforms, but in order to use full features on your iPhone, you might need to make a $0.99 in-app purchase. The app lets you combine photos and videos, and place them into one of many predefined and fully adjustable split screen frames and collage formats. However, this app works best with clips made from your own phone and may not be the best choice if you need to import multimedia from diverse sources. Considering that most social media users these days shoot and edit their clips in the same breath, Vidstitch Frames could be sufficiently advanced for their needs.

### 7\. [Acapella](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acapella-from-picplaypost/id924635678)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Acapella](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acapella-from-picplaypost.jpg)

While this is primarily a music editing app, it can also be used with reasonable success for creating and sharing videos. Most importantly, it supports multi-frame layouts and allows you to combine several video clips to accompany the multi-track sound. Various frames and backgrounds are available to use as plug-and-play elements while you are making a new split screen video. The songs and videos you can record with Acapella are limited to 10 minutes in duration, although this should be more than enough for all except the most ambitious users. On the other hand, demanding users who primarily want to edit videos rather than music can probably find a better split screen app.

### 8\. [Video Merge, Side by Side](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.irisstudio.videomerge&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Merge, Side by Side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-merge-side-by-side.jpg)

Installing this Android app will instantly enable you to create unique videos by merging two different clips into one. The app shows both streams together and can place them side by side or one atop of another, depending on user preference. This is a great way to show two different shots of the same event or summarize the footage from your travels without spending a ton of time. While the app is very intuitive and easy to learn, it can’t work with more than two video sources and it sorely lacks some of the more sophisticated features that a premium split screen video editor should have.

### 9\. [4xcamera](https://www.roland.com/us/products/4xcamera/)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

As its name implies, 4Xcamera can handle up to four independent inputs containing both video and audio components. As such, it can be a powerful tool for recording live music performances and editing the footage to get amazing multi-screen music videos. Each of the performers can be in a separate location, but this split screen app allows for simultaneous recording and real-time playback in a very effortless fashion. Three aspect ratios are supported (1:1, 9:16, and 16:9), along with 10 unique split screen patterns for each of those formats. The free version is available from the App Store as well as Google Play, although paid features might be necessary for the best possible results.

### 10\. [Multiple Videos at Same Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badongutech.playvideos4fun&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields. It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. It’s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesn’t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.

**Conclusion**

The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.

It is best suited for playback rather than video editing, and most of the options are basic viewing-related commands such as rewinding, searching, or volume control. On a more positive note, this app can be easily connected to a large screen TV or a movie projector and used for multi-screen promotions and presentations. The app has minimal hardware requirements and is extremely easy to use, even for a person with no experience in multimedia production. It’s fair to say that the app has a clearly defined target group and serves well in its primary role, but it doesn’t compare favorably with some of the general purpose editors presented earlier.

**Conclusion**

The field is quite broad when it comes to split screen video apps, with numerous high-quality products available for free or at a low cost. The most optimal choice of editing software depends on numerous factors, including the level of experience and the purpose of the videos. With so many options to choose from, every advanced social media user can create brilliant videos that combine multiple sources and create a dynamic, modern format. It takes some practice to master the split screen tool and get the layout just right without overwhelming the viewer, but this is easier to achieve when you have professional-level editing tools installed on your smartphone.

As we use our mobile phones for producing and watching videos more and more every year, the demand for advanced options is constantly on the rise. Split screen is one of such options that users expect from their video apps nowadays, and products that include it stand a better chance to gain a steady foothold in the market. As a response, many new video tools equipped with the [split screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are being launched, but not all of them offer the same level of technical quality and user experience.

To help you differentiate between the competing apps and select the one that works best for you, we prepared an overview of the best split screen video apps for iOS and Android you can use to record, create, and share great-looking multimedia with minimal effort.

### 1\. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

This is Apple’s own video app and it is generally regarded as one of the better in its class, especially considering it’s free to download. The app allows users to shoot, edit, and publish their videos and basically acts as a full-scale portable production studio capable of creating professional-looking movie trailers or even short films. Among the numerous advanced features, iMovie supports split-screen and picture-in-picture options, while also making it very simple to add titles or credits in a wide variety of styles. Because of this, it can be sufficient for anyone whose editing needs are not too complex. Even professional users can start working in iMovie before switching to a more robust Apple editing tool such as Final Cut Pro X.

### 2\. [PicPlay Post Movie Video Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flambestudios.picplaypost&hl=en)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - PicPlayPost ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picplaypost-movie-video-editor.jpg)

This versatile tool can be used to create and edit video clips or photo collages with a broad range of eye-catching features. It supports the split screen option with up to 9 tiles organized in a 3 x 3 pattern, and offers a lot of pre-defined backgrounds and layouts. Most importantly, you can choose between 9:16 and 16:9 aspect ratios, so the outgoing clips are ready for sharing on any social media platform in landscape or portrait orientation. It’s perfect for creating simple side-by-side comparisons as well as more complex collages that consist of still photos, GIFs, and video clips. The app is easy to use and requires very little training to achieve spectacular results.

### 3\. [Video Collage and Photo Grid](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-collage-and-photo-grid/id779353036)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Collage and Photo Grid ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-collage-and-photo-grid.jpg)

The advantage of any specialized app is that it can perform the chosen function very well, and in the case of a video collage app that means a lot of split screen presets and customization opportunities. You can choose from 64 different layouts featuring up to four videos that can play at the same time. All layouts can be manually adjusted to get the best possible fit with your content, while frame textures can be changed as well. The resulting video collage can be combined with music for a true multimedia feel. Instant preview is a very useful feature as well since it allows the authors to experiment freely while they are searching for the perfect layout of the screen.

### 4\. [Split Screen Video](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/split-screen-videos/id1141913470#?platform=iphone)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** $2.99

![Split Screen Video Making App -Split Screen Video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-videos-app.jpg)

With this simple digital tool, you can easily combine from two to four videos into a great, dynamic clip. This is an Apple-only application and has a modest price considering the range of its features. Videos can be placed into frames, and their size and style can be adjusted at will so that some tiles are larger than others. For those who enjoy speed and convenience, there are six preset layouts that can be used to quickly put together a stunning split screen video. Since the interface is extremely user-friendly, this can take as little as a few minutes to execute.

### 5\. [Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perfect-video-editor-collage/id633335631)

**Availability:** iOS

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Perfect Video Editor, Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-video-editor-collage.jpg)

There are numerous advantages of this split screen video app, starting from the simplicity of use that makes it ideal for beginners and casual users. Perfect Video Editor supports practically every aspect ratio you can think of, so it works well as a universal editing tool regardless of the intended use of the video. The split screen feature is sadly limited to just two video channels, somewhat limiting the range of options at your disposal. Picture and picture and chroma key features can partially make up for this limitation, along with animated subtitles and great transitions that add some extra oomph to the final product.

### 6 [Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram/id712908978)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Vidstitch Frames for Instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidstitch-frames-for-instagram.jpg)

You can do a lot of different things with this video editing app, although it’s best suited for the creation of Instagram videos. The free version is available for both major OS platforms, but in order to use full features on your iPhone, you might need to make a $0.99 in-app purchase. The app lets you combine photos and videos, and place them into one of many predefined and fully adjustable split screen frames and collage formats. However, this app works best with clips made from your own phone and may not be the best choice if you need to import multimedia from diverse sources. Considering that most social media users these days shoot and edit their clips in the same breath, Vidstitch Frames could be sufficiently advanced for their needs.

### 7\. [Acapella](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acapella-from-picplaypost/id924635678)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Acapella](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/acapella-from-picplaypost.jpg)

While this is primarily a music editing app, it can also be used with reasonable success for creating and sharing videos. Most importantly, it supports multi-frame layouts and allows you to combine several video clips to accompany the multi-track sound. Various frames and backgrounds are available to use as plug-and-play elements while you are making a new split screen video. The songs and videos you can record with Acapella are limited to 10 minutes in duration, although this should be more than enough for all except the most ambitious users. On the other hand, demanding users who primarily want to edit videos rather than music can probably find a better split screen app.

### 8\. [Video Merge, Side by Side](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.irisstudio.videomerge&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

![Split Screen Video Making App - Video Merge, Side by Side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-merge-side-by-side.jpg)

Installing this Android app will instantly enable you to create unique videos by merging two different clips into one. The app shows both streams together and can place them side by side or one atop of another, depending on user preference. This is a great way to show two different shots of the same event or summarize the footage from your travels without spending a ton of time. While the app is very intuitive and easy to learn, it can’t work with more than two video sources and it sorely lacks some of the more sophisticated features that a premium split screen video editor should have.

### 9\. [4xcamera](https://www.roland.com/us/products/4xcamera/)

**Availability:** iOS, Android

 **Price:** Free

As its name implies, 4Xcamera can handle up to four independent inputs containing both video and audio components. As such, it can be a powerful tool for recording live music performances and editing the footage to get amazing multi-screen music videos. Each of the performers can be in a separate location, but this split screen app allows for simultaneous recording and real-time playback in a very effortless fashion. Three aspect ratios are supported (1:1, 9:16, and 16:9), along with 10 unique split screen patterns for each of those formats. The free version is available from the App Store as well as Google Play, although paid features might be necessary for the best possible results.

### 10\. [Multiple Videos at Same Time](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.badongutech.playvideos4fun&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US)

**Availability:** Android

 **Price:** Free

This practical and intuitive split screen software can play up to four different videos at the same time, albeit only in the basic layout with four equally sized fields.
