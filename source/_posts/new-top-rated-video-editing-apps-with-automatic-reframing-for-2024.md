Besides making intros, you can also use it to create dynamic trailers for the videos you share on social media. You can choose from a broad range of templates, and pick the one that best matches the style of the video you would like to promote.

Moreover, the app lets you animate all text overlays, apply transitions between video clips and you can use the music library to create soundtracks for trailers. Optionally, you can import your own music into the app and use it as a soundtrack for the intro or the trailer you’re working on. The only downside is that you must make an in-app purchase if you want to animate text or add transitions to your videos. Also, you should keep in mind that the free version of this app watermarks all intros and trailers you create with it.

**Conclusion**

All major movie productions utilize trailers as an advertising tool that helps them inform the audience about their new projects. The movie trailer apps for iPads and iPhones allow you to do the same without having to spend a lot of time and money on making them. Which of the top ten movie trailer apps for iPhones and iPads are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.
