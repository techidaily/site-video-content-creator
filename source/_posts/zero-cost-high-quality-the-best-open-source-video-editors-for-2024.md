## 1\. OpenShot

[OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/download/) is a free and **open-source video editor** with no premium features. In contrast, the website provides a donation option.

**Pros**

* Easy-to-use interface
* Unlimited layers

**Cons**

* It sometimes lags, which is inconvenient

## 2\. Shotcut

However, because Shotcut was created for Linux, many users may find the UI a little strange. Regardless, it's still a fantastic editor.

Shotcut also has a lot of sound editing capabilities, so it's great for audiophiles.

* Offers smooth service

**Cons**

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

### 5\. Gihosoft Free Video Cutter

It seems Gihosoft programmers understand that all fingers are not equal, and sometimes we need editing help on a budget. Therefore, if you need to trim videos on your PC while on a budget and maintain the quality, you might give Gihosoft a trial. You can trim and edit videos of different formats in a few seconds. Import and export of files work fine, and it has an easy-to-use interface and supports frame-by-frame edits.

### 6\. DaVinci Resolve

DaVinci is an amazing tool for all-around editing, and not just for video trimming because it offers amazing editing options like audio enhancement, color correction, special effects, and animation, all for a one-time fee of $357.01\. It works perfectly fine on Linux, Windows, and iOS; though you might need to use it with other editing software, the available features are amazing for professional editing. Access to updated features is available to premium users alone, though there’s a free option.

![video trimmer for pc- davinci resolve](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/video-trimmer-for-pc-5.jpg)

##### Pros

### 7\. Cyberlink PowerDirector

Though desktop video trimmers are amazing, some options make it easy for editors to handle professional projects, and Cyberlink PowerDirector meets that list. Not just as a video trimmer but as a video editing software that supports a wide range of file formats, including MKV, , MP4, M2TS, and XAVC. You can resize for upload on stream sites like YouTube and Vimeo.

Want to try it out? There is an option for a 30-days free trial, with watermarks on edited videos, though. And you can’t save 4K videos too.

### 9\. Lightworks

You are looking for a top-quality video trimmer that is compatible with Linux, as well as windows and iOS? Then you can try Lightworks then.

Though it is cloud-based software, you can bet the services match most open source options. The best part is that you have options to export your video as YouTube Videos, 4K films, commercials, and social media ads. The features make it extremely easy in a few steps.

Can’t send to YouTube directly with an option of only 720p to the saved on PC.

The free version does not support MOV, WebM, AVI, and MKV.

### 10\. Avidemux

Looking at the website, one might not look at Avidemux as an amazing choice, but there’s always more to what meets the eyes, as the saying goes. With a collection of about 500+ video effects and fascinating features like merge, trim, and split options, it is sure that you will get just the best professional outlook for your next video project. All thanks to its compatibility on both iOS and Windows and the that it supports 100+ video formats. Do you intend to share on social media? Avidemux allows you that option and can be done in just a few steps.

Organized interface.

No tutorials.

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.
