## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

## Image Size Made Easy: Calculating and Adjusting Ratios

You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.

The standard resolution of your screen stretched from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wider one. So, producers started making movies that fit on both screens. After the standardization of aspect ratio display, broadcasters pay attention to the image ratio of clips.

So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let's get started.

#### In this article

01 [What is the image ratio?](#Part 1)

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

02 [Where Can I Find the Image ratio?](#Part 2)

03 [How to adjust image ratio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is the image ratio?

The image or aspect ratio is the ratio of width to the height of a picture without any pixels attached. It is expressed with two a colon that separates two numbers, for example, 16:9.

In cinematography, common image ratios are 1.85:1 and 2.39:1, and in TV photography, it is 4:3 and 16:9\. However, in still photography, the standard aspect ratio is 3:2.

## Part 2 Where Can I Find the Image ratio?

To select the right photo print size, you must consider the photo ratio and the print ratio. You can not accidentally choose the balance that needs cropping from the sides of the photo.

So, first, you must know how or where you can find the image ratio. The following are the methods to do so:

### Method 1: Check your Camera

The image ratio depends directly on the camera's sensor. You can find the correct balance for photo print based on your camera type. For example, APS-C and Full-frame cameras shoot in a 3:2 ratio. But compact cameras often shoot in a 4:3 ratio.

The photos that you click with your smartphones have a 16:9 or 4:3 ratio. The picture below shows some common photo ratios by type of camera and where it will look great in the home.

![ Common image Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-1.jpg)

### Method 2: Find Image Information

Unlike the photo ratios, image information determines the original width and height of the image in pixels. You can measure the picture dimensions in any unit, but you will always see the web or digital images in pixels.

Always remember that two different pictures with the same image ratio may not have the same dimensions. For example, a picture with size 1920X1080 pixels and a photo with size 1280x720 pixels can both have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### Method 3: Check with Photoshop

You can quickly check the image ratio in Photoshop (picture ratio calculator) using a crop tool. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below:

**●** Open the image in Photoshop.

**●** Choose a crop tool.

**●** Select the photo ratio.

**●** Test different image ratios. You can begin with the standard ratios like 3:2, 16:9, 4:3, or 5:4.

**●** If the crop frame captures the whole picture, it means you have already found the correct ratio.

Do you want a photo print in panorama or square shape? If yes, crop the picture to make it fit a different image ratio. For instance, edit the photo to fit a 1:1 ratio for a square shape.

Or crop a picture to 2:1\. 3:1\. 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1 ratio for a panorama photo.

![Photoshop testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/calculate-find-and-adjust-image-ratio-2.jpg)

### Method 4: Image Ratio Calculation

You can find the image ratio using the resolution of a photo easily on a window's system. To do so, right-click on an image file and scroll down to the Properties. Under details, you will notice, size of a photo in pixels.

To calculate the photo ratio, divide the width by the height of an image. If the total is an integer, multiply it by other numbers. These numbers are photo ratios.

**Example 1:**

**●** Photo is 4966px by 3312px

**●** Divide 4966 by 3312= 1.5

**●** Now, multiply 1.5 with 2 to obtain a whole number (1.5 X 2= 3)

**●** The photo's ratio is 3:2

**Example 2:**

**●** Photo is 4416 x 3312 px

**●** Divide 4416 by 3312= 1.3

**●** Multiply 1.3 with 3 to obtain a whole number(1.3 x 3= 3.9 or approx. 4)

**●** The photo's ratio is 4:3

## Part 3 How to adjust image ratio

Image ratio is significant in the videography business. But adjusting the video aspect ratio is more critical. Therefore, if you are a video editor, you must know how to do it. There are plenty of options to adjust the aspect ratio, and one of them is to use a photo aspect ratio calculator.

If you want to make permanent adjustments, use a convertor or editor. "Wondershare Filmora" is the best video editor that allows you to create videos with different aspect ratios and adjust these ratios easily.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Back in 1999, Apple launched Final Cut Pro, and the software didn't take so long to become the first choice for video editors and post-production agencies.

The main feature it has that makes it stands out from any other video-editing software out there is that it is made exclusively to operate on Mac only, and that allowed Apple to make it fully enhanced for speed and efficiency enabling it to[**edit 4K**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) **UHD footage** with no rendering issues.

This video editing software will cost you $300 to buy, and as mentioned above it will require you to have a Mac OS, so if you don't have both or if you are a[beginner in video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) we are suggesting a few alternatives for you that you might choose one from to start your video editing journey.

## Best Free & Paid Final Cut Pro X Alternatives on Windows/ Mac/ Linux

### 1. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora made professional video editing easy with its easy professional tools. Besides basic video editing tools, you can now group timeline clips, range markers, or add audio and video to unlimited video tracks. You can perfect your audio with the automatic audio sync, audio compressor, or audio noise reduction, and perform detailed color correction with plentiful presets auto-correction, and color wheels. It also supports animation and motion tracking. It is easy to use and has low system requirements. Download it now to have a try!

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2. [Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/)

Avidemux is a **free open-source and cross-platform** (Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X) video editor designed for quick video joining, trimming, and filtering tasks. It supports different video formats such as MP44, MPG, AVI, OGM, MKV, FLV, and more. Here is also a [getting-started tutorial for Avidemux](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can refer to.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/avidemux.jpg)

**Pros as an alternative to FCPX for Windows:**

* Open-source video editing software and free
* A simple interface and easy to use

**Cons:**

May have problems dealing with some types of formats.

### 3. [VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)

VirtualDub is a strong video editing tool on Windows with many useful features that can help you make different kinds of changes to the video but keeping the video’s quality the same as before. It also has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files and can be extended with third-party video filters.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Has video capturing option;
* Can be extended with third-party video filters;
* Has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files.

**Cons:**

Outdated UI design.

### 4. [Video Toolbox](https://www.videotoolbox.com/)

Video Toolbox is a[free online video editing tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)that has a rich set of video functions. But like many online apps, it imposes a size restriction of 300 MB for your video files. To use it, you have to register first and upload the target files either from the hard disk or online video sites. Then fish the merging task use the command from a drop-down.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-toolbox.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Supports many video formats;
* Different video editing options.

**Cons:**

Has the size limitation of video (600 MB).

### 5. [Format Factory](https://format-factory.en.softonic.com/)

Format Factory is a full-featured video and audio converter. It can convert video, audio, picture, and rip CDs, DVDs to other file formats, as well as create ISO image files. On top of that, it provides a subset of tools that handle file splitting and merging. You can also change the format and size of the output file.

![free video joiner](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/format-factory.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Supports many video formats;
* Basic video editing options.

**Cons:**

Can't convert audio files.

### 6. [Movica](https://sourceforge.net/projects/movica/)

This software is, in essence, a user interface for other open-source tools that are somewhat user-unfriendly, enabling an understandable user interface for the best free tools out there. As a software package though, there is nothing wrong with this approach, and the tools available for joining and merging are first-rate, and the software works very fast, whilst offering a wide range of compatible video formats.

The interface is a little clunky, but it does the job and the software has additional tools for other editing work such as cutting and trimming as well, the added functionality in combination with a more basic interface can make some operations a touch confusing though.

![Movica](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/movica.jpg)

Ultimately a little more complicated to use, but very good.

### 7. [Cyberlink PowerDirector 365](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)

PowerDirector 365 is a professional video editor in the Cyberlink family. It is a great [Final Cut Pro alternative on Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Users can use multiple cameras to make various green-screen effects and make split-screen effects. What's more, you can control frame-by-frame with its motion tracking. It also supports using plug-ins ranging from animated titles to travel packs. The official recommendation of the operating system is Windows 10/8/7\. It works best on 64 bit.

![Cyberlink PowerDirector 365](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Cyberlink-PowerDirector-365.jpg)

**Pros:**

* 10 UI languages are supported including French, Dutch, and Korean.
* It supports cloud storage for co-working.

**Cons:**

It only offers a limited learning course.

### 8. [VEGAS PRO 17](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

Vegas Pro is a long-standing professional video editing software on Windows. Now, it just released Pro 17 to give it more features, so it is also an excellent Final Cut Pro alternative. At this time, VEGAS PRO 17 features a high-speed video editing experience with GPU acceleration and intuitive design. Those features were not specifically mentioned before. With the new color grading features, VEGAS PRO 17 can compete with Final Cut Pro.

![VEGAS PRO 17](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/vegas-pro-17.jpg)

Very fast video editing with the newly released version.
