However, they note that Lightworks does not provide advanced video editors with all the tools they need. It's best for intermediate users.

**Takeaway**

Lightworks is a fantastic alternative to iMovie for Windows 10+ users. However, it requires you to be quite knowledgeable about video editing tools. This editor has a slightly higher learning curve than others. But once you learn how to use Lightworks, creating quality videos would be super easy.

A [G2 reviewe](https://www.g2.com/products/flexclip/reviews/flexclip-review-5138003)r says, "I have used many video editing tools so far, but none is close to FlexClip when it comes to video editing."

**Takeaway**

You can't go wrong with FlexClip. It has powerful tools making it a great iMovie alternative for Windows. You don't even have to install it; it's an online tool. Unfortunately, that has some downsides. You need to wait for the website to finish loading before working because it scrolls down for each line that gets loaded.

**Takeaway**

WeVideo is a solid alternative for iMovie for Windows 10/11, but only if you are willing to pay. The free version has lots of restrictions. For example, you can only export 5 minutes of content per month.

### 11\. [OpenShot - Best for Amateurs](https://www.openshot.org/)

![openshot interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-1.jpg)

OpenShot has a straightforward interface, making it beginner-friendly. It has some fantastic tools you'll find helpful. There's a catch with beginner-friendly editors, though. They don't have the advanced features you can find on other video editors. You can say that for OpenShot.

**Takeaway**

* User-friendly

 Cons

* The free version has lots of limitations
* Importing videos to the website takes a long time

**G2 Rating:** 4.4 Stars

**Supported OS:** [Windows](https://www.wevideo.com/), [Mac](https://www.wevideo.com/), [Linux](https://www.wevideo.com/)

**User Review**

Social media influencers and marketers need to check out WeVideo. A reviewer of this video editing tool on [G2](https://www.g2.com/products/wevideo/reviews/wevideo-review-5077916) said, "It's got a handful of Templates that you can use to explore your creativity and inventiveness when creating your content."

**Takeaway**

WeVideo is a solid alternative for iMovie for Windows 10/11, but only if you are willing to pay. The free version has lots of restrictions. For example, you can only export 5 minutes of content per month.

### 11\. [OpenShot - Best for Amateurs](https://www.openshot.org/)

![openshot interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/10/imovie-for-windows-11-1.jpg)

OpenShot has a straightforward interface, making it beginner-friendly. It has some fantastic tools you'll find helpful. There's a catch with beginner-friendly editors, though. They don't have the advanced features you can find on other video editors. You can say that for OpenShot.

**Key Features**

* 3D Animation
* Text Editor
* Keyframing
* Decent selection of templates and filters

**Price:** Free

 Pros

* Beginner-friendly
* Includes a wide range of editing tools
* Lots of export options

 Cons

* Lack of advanced tools like Picture-in-Picture or Chroma Key
* Very laggy to use sometimes

**G2 Rating:** 4.5 Stars

**Supported OS:** [Windows](https://www.openshot.org/download/), [Mac](https://www.openshot.org/download/), [Linux](https://www.openshot.org/download/)

**User Review**

OpenShot is a great introductory software for video editing. Its simplicity, ergonomic design, and set of handy tools make it perfect for beginners. A [G2 review](https://www.g2.com/products/openshot-video-editor/reviews/openshot-video-editor-review-6946676) states, "I do not have a degree in video editing, but the products from my Openshot edits were of high quality."

**Takeaway**

Some tools are intimidating for beginners; there are many buttons, and you don't know what each one does. That's not a problem when using OpenShot. Its simple interface is easy to understand, making it the best tool for beginners.

Step5 Drag and drop the files to the timeline. Please note that the last one you add will always be placed after the previous one. Thus, you need to drag the file on the timeline to put it in the desired position. Press **Play** to preview.
