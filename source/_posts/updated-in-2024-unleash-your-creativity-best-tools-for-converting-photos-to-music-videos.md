![adding new movie in stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/adding-new-movie-in-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Step 2: Set the object you wish to capture in the frame. Let us consider one example where we will turn over an object. Click the camera icon to capture the shot. Move the thing a little and again tap on the shutter icon. Repeat the process until you have moved it all the way around. Once done, click on the play button.

![changing frame rate on stop motion studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/changing-frame-rate-on-stop-motion-studio.jpg)

Tip: To ensure that your object is in the right place, you can use different controls like grid and onion skin. The grid will give you an idea of where you placed the subject in the frame. The onion skin puts the last frame you captured on top of your camera's live view. In this way, you can see how far you moved your subject between frames.

Step 3: You can click as many pictures as you need to convey your story. After clicking all the pictures, you can edit them as per your requirements. To increase or decrease the speed at which your video plays, change the frame rate by choosing the number of pictures to be shown per second when you play the video. Play the video to see how your work turned out. If you like the end result, exit the editor.

Step 4: Now select the animation that you just saved. Click on the export icon which you will find at the top left of the screen—select animated GIF from the pulldown menu. Export the file to Google drive, mail yourself or upload it on your social media profile. AirDrop the file to other iPhone users if you are an iPhone user.

On iMotion, the user can manually control focus, exposure, or white balance. It has unlimited movie length, and you can also preview your projects at different frame rates. There is an option to autosave and directly preview your creation. If you want to do reverse playback, you can do that too.

Export all the video projects iMotion in 4K, 1080p, or 720p resolutions. However, only newer versions of iPhones and iPads can support 4k resolution. The free version of iMotion offers only limited options; get the full version to use the advanced features.

### Closing Word

Stop motion animation is a simple and exciting way to create movement on a screen. Taking hundreds of photos to create a stop motion animation is not a huge task anymore. Anyone can easily do it on their smartphone camera, or it's even better if you use a DSLR.

Stop Motion Studio is rightly called a studio as it has all the tools needed to create a stop motion animation. It gives you complete control over all camera settings and editing features.

So, bring your photos to life today with stop motion studio free or stop motion pro.
