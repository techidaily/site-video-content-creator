## Part 1 What is the Aspect Ratio and Its Importance?

An aspect ratio in the simplest terms is defined as the relationship of the image width with its height. Denoted by x: y, where x is the width and h, is the height, an aspect ratio defines the shape of an image and can be different for different platforms and sites. Thus, one image with a certain aspect ratio might not fit perfectly on another site or a platform that supports a different aspect ratio. For instance, an image created for Facebook might not appear to be right in size when posted on Instagram. Similarly, an image seen on a smartphone will have a different look when watched on a big TV screen.

It is important to have the right aspect ratio as a set or recommended by the site or the platform so that they look appealing and interesting. To change ratio of image, there are several tools available.
