**Step 1: Download and Install Filmora**

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-2.jpg)

**Step 2: Import the Video You Want to Rotate**

The next is to bring the video file to Filmora’s library before proceeding. To do that, click on the “Movie Clip” icon in the center of the interface to select the clip from your computer’s hard drive.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-3.jpg)

Double-click or select the video and click the “Open” button to import files. The importing process may take several seconds or a few minutes, depending on the video size.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-4.jpg)

If you’re using Filmora for the first time, you might see the “Create Proxy File” message popping up right after the video import. So, simply click on the “Yes” button to go ahead.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-5.jpg)

Your video will be stored in the “Project Media” tab and will be visible next to the preview window.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-13.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-14.jpg)

Now, click the “OK” button to apply rotation and return to the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-15.jpg)

**Step 5: Save and Export Rotated Video to Your Widows or MAC**

Here you will learn how to save the project and then export it. If you have already saved the project in the beginning, skip reading this part and directly hit the “Export” button.

Contrarily, you can also directly export your files without saving the project. But you won’t be able to make changes to the same project in the future as all source files will be lost. Therefore, saving the project and then exporting files is recommended.

So, if you’re done with step 4, save your project before going further.

You can go to the “File” tab, choose “Save Project,” and rename the video.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-16.jpg)

Rename your file and click on the “Save” button.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-17.jpg)

The new name will appear at the top of Filmora’s interface.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-18.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Right after the above step, you will get another message to help you decide whether you want to keep the resolution of the video to its original settings or match the media. Choose “Match to Media” for fast rendering.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-8.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

Just below “Rotate,” you will see the “Flip” option with “Horizontal” and “Vertical” mirror icons. Choosing any one of the icons will make your video mirror flip in horizontal or vertical directions.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-12.jpg)

The third option is “Scale” beneath the “Flip” option. Similar to the rotate option, this tool also has an adjustment bar. You can make adjustments to magnify or de-magnify the clip to fit the screen. Although this option isn’t mandatory, you can still use it if you find the need.

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-6.jpg)

**Step 3: Drag and Drop the Video on Filmora’s Timeline**

To rotate the video, first, you need to add it to the track. For that, take your mouse on the video, and select it by clicking the right button on your mouse. Keep holding the button to drag the video on the timeline. Remove your finger from the button after placing the clip on the track.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-7.jpg)

However, if you’re a professional video editor, feel free to select the option that suits you the most.

**Step 4: Rotate Your Video with Filmora**

Double-click anywhere on the video that is already on the timeline.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-9.jpg)

You will see three tabs – “Video,” “Color,” and “Animation.” So choose the “Video” tab and click on the “Transform” option.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-10.jpg)

Once done, you will see three important options, which will help you rotate the video.

First, you will notice the “Rotate” option with an adjustment bar. This option will turn your video to different angles of your choice.

All you need to do is play with the adjustments by grabbing the “Round” knob-like button while keeping an eye on the preview window to see the results.

![avi video rotators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-rotators-11.jpg)

You can see the picture at the bottom of the timeline. If needed, adjust the position of your subject. Make sure that the location you choose has plenty of light. If not, you also use a lamp for good light.

Tip: Keeping your phone or camera steady while making your stop-motion project is the key. You can use a tripod, a selfie stick, or a gimbal to keep your device as still as possible. If you don't own any of these, keep your device on something sturdy and make sure that you do not change its place until you capture all the images needed for your project. This way all your shots will be consistent.

Step 2: Move your subject or change its position and take a picture. Repeat the process until you complete your story. To make your stop-motion smooth, make small changes to the position of your subject between shots.

You can also add more frames per second. Generally, you should add 10 frames per second. But you can go for 25 frames per second to make a smoother video. All the pictures you snap are automatically added to the editor in chronological order.

Step 3: Once you have captured images for your project, add sound by going to the sound menu in the top left of the dashboard. You can record sounds, upload sounds, or select sounds from Cloud Stop Motion's gallery. You can also add text to your Cloud Stop Motion project if you want.

Step 4: Click on play button to preview your project and see if your motion picture turned out as per your liking or not. If you do not like something, go back and make changes. Once done, download your video from cloudstop motion.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Sharing unedited photos and videos on your social media accounts can negatively reflect on the number of views and like your posts are getting. You don’t necessarily have to know a lot about photo or video editing process in order to add a vignette to a picture or adjust its color, brightness or highlights. As a matter of fact, all you need is a great app that lets you emphasize the center of the image and darken its edges. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best vignette apps for iPhones and Android devices that make the vignetting process fun.

## Top 10 Vignette Apps in 2024 \[Free & Paid\]

Vignettes can be used to make your selfies look more artistic or to increase the contrast between the edges and the center of a landscape photo. Even though you can use vignetting in any type of photo or video, it is still advisable to carefully choose the images to which you’d like to add this effect, since the results you’re going to get depend mostly on the quality of the original footage. Here are the ten best vignette apps in 2019.

#### 1. [Apple Photos App](https://support.apple.com/photos)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

iPhone users can edit their photos with the built-in Photos app that offers a variety of photo and video shooting modes as well as a rich collection of filters and effects. The **Vignette effect** can be accessed from the **Edit Photo menu,** by tapping on the **Adjust button** and then opening the **Add menu** and selecting the effect from the list. The **Auto option** will be enabled by default and it will automatically adjust the vignette based on the composition of your photo. Alternatively, you can use the **strength, Softness or Radius** settings to control the size of the darkened area of the image or the vignette’s falloff. Even though the Photos app offers basic Vignetting tools that let you choose which part of a photo is going to be affected by the effect or how intense the effect is going to be, it is still better to use a more powerful photo editing app to create vignettes from your iPhone.

#### 2. [Final Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/app/final-touch-beautiful-high/id963756379?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-touch-vignette.jpg)

When creating a vignette, the lack of control over the feathering or opacity features can significantly limit your ability to produce vignettes that look natural. The Final Touch app is equipped with powerful vignetting tools that let you choose between **square, ellipse or circle shapes** of vignettes, move and rotate a vignette or adjust the feather size and fall off. However, the app doesn’t let you take photos, which means that all images you want to edit have to be imported from the camera roll. The Final Touch also offers a number of preset vignettes you can easily apply to a photo and customize in any way you want. After you’ve completed the vignetting process, you can share a photo to your social media accounts directly from the app.

#### 3. [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

This photo editing app offers much more than the Vignette tool, as its users can process images in both **JPEG and RAW** file formats. Tap on the **Pencil icon** to access the app’s **Tool menu**, select the **Vignette option** and then proceed to adjust the **Outer and Inner Brightness** sliders. This will enable you to precisely define how dark you want the photo’s edges to be or how bright the central part of the picture is. To change the size of the vignette you just have to pinch in or out on the phone’s screen and **Center Size option** will appear near the bottom of the screen. Tap on the **Save button** once you’re happy with the results and then hit **Export** to create a copy of the photo that contains the changes you’ve made.

#### 4. [VSCO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vsco-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful photo editor, the VSCO app is also a community of photography enthusiasts where you can discover inspiring work or connect with like-minded people. The app also features a collection of effects that enable you to recreate the look of vintage film produced by **Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.** Despite remarkably powerful photo editing options, VSCO is far from a perfect choice if you want to add a vignette to your photo since it only offers **basic vignetting tools**. You can add a vignette to a photo the same way you’d apply any other effect, but you won’t have access to advanced feathering options. iPhone and Android users in need of an app that lets them shoot and edit photos and videos should give VSCO a chance. Keep in mind that video editing options are only available if you purchase the VSCO X Membership.

#### 5. Afterlight 2

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/afterlight-2/id1293122457?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/afterlight-2-vignette-app.jpg)

iPhone photographers who would like to use photo editing tools such as **Curves, Selective Hue/Saturation or Clarify** are going to love using the Afterlife 2 app. Adding a vignette to a photo requires you to just tap on the **Adjustment Tools icon** and then **browse through the adjustment tools icons until you find the Vignette option**. Just tap on the Vignette icon to create the effect and then proceed to adjust the settings. Don’t expect too much control over the vignette size or feathering options, since Afterlight 2 only offers basic vignetting tools. Optionally, you can use Afterlight 2 as an **extension for the Apple Photos App** if you want to broaden the scope of photo editing tools you have at your disposal when using this native iPhone app.

#### 6. [PhotoToaster](https://itunes.apple.com/app/phototoaster-photo-editor-filters-effects-and-borders/id433671262?ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $2.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phototoaster-photo-editor-vignette-app.jpg)

A brief look at the list of features PhotoToaster app provides will leave you wondering if there is anything this app can’t do. There are over eighty different one-click settings in **Lightning, Vignette, Texture or Border** categories that grant you total creative control over the photo editing process. You can add a vignette to a photo you imported into the app from your iPhone’s camera roll, but you can’t use PhotoToaster to take photos. Furthermore, you can use the lightning adjustments to balance the shadows and highlights or process colors on separate channels. The PhotoToaster app is a great asset to all photographers who take photos with their iPhones, not only because it lets them create vignettes in just a few taps, but because it enables them to edit their photos professionally.

#### 7. [PicsArt Photo Editor](https://picsart.com/apps/)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.picsart.studio&hl=en), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/picsart-photo-editor-collage/id587366035?mt=8)

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/picsart-vignette-app.jpg)

Besides editing photos, you can also use the PicsArt app to create collages from your Smartphone. The app is also equipped with a rich effects library that contains the Vignette effect you can easily customize and apply to a photo. **Tap on the Effects icon**, **select the Vignette effect from the Fx section and then tap on the Gear icon to customize the effect**. Adjust the **Radius and Fade** sliders before picking the color of the vignette. **Tap on the Checkmark icon to confirm the changes** you’ve made and save the photo. PicsArt is a vibrant community of photography enthusiasts where you can share your works with other users or connect with photographers you like.

#### 8. [EffectsStudio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/effects-studio/id780467456?mt=8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/effects-studio-app.jpg)

The user-friendly interface and the abundance of photo editing options, make the EffectsStudio one of the best iOS-based photo editing app you can use to add vignettes to your photos. You just have to import a photo from the camera roll and enter the app’s **Edit mode** to start processing a photo. You can adjust the Vignette effect’s settings, by simply dragging sliders, and all changes you make will be immediately displayed on the screen. Make sure to complete all basic photo editing actions before you add a vignette to a photo in order to avoid losing a part of a picture. The app offers nearly eighty standard filters, more than two hundred custom filters as well as fifty effects you can use to enhance your photos.

#### 9. [EyeEm](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eyeem-photography/id445638931?mt=8)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baseapp.eyeem&hl=en), iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eyeem-photography-vignette.jpg)

EyeEm is a global community of photographers, where you can sell your photos, develop your photography skills or connect with photographers whose work you admire. You can use some of the adjustable photo filters or manipulate your images in any way you want with this app. Creating a vignette with EyeEm is easy since you just have to apply the effect and tweak the settings. The best part is that you can combine the Vignette effect with other options such as **Contrast, Exposure or Sharpen** to create a visual style you want. Sharing photos on this platform can help you get useful advice from more experienced photographers who can suggest a creative way to use vignettes or any other photo effects.

#### 10. [ToolWiz Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.btows.photo&hl=en%5FUS)

**Price:** Free, but contains in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android, [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/toolwiz-photos/id1002417201?mt=8)

This simple photo editing app offers **AI filters**, and effects you can apply to a picture in just a single tap. All effects, including the Vignette effect located in the **Photography menu**, are fully customizable, so you can **adjust the radius or choose where the center of the vignette is going to be**. When done, you just have to tap on the **Checkmark icon** to confirm the changes you made and then proceed to apply an art filter like **Grainy Film or use Fish Eye, Double Exposure or Mirror effects**. The app’s file sharing capabilities could be better since you have to save all the photos you edit to your phone.

**Conclusion**

Making the edges of a photo darker can without a doubt make your photos stand out, but falling in love with vignettes and using this effect excessively is not necessarily a great idea. Using vignettes in your photos subtly so they aren’t easy to notice will probably create the best results. Which iPhone or Android vignette app do you use to edit your photos? Leave a comment and let us know.

#### 2. [Final Touch](https://itunes.apple.com/app/final-touch-beautiful-high/id963756379?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Price:** $0.99

**Compatibility:** iOS

![Vignette Effects app ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-touch-vignette.jpg)

When creating a vignette, the lack of control over the feathering or opacity features can significantly limit your ability to produce vignettes that look natural. The Final Touch app is equipped with powerful vignetting tools that let you choose between **square, ellipse or circle shapes** of vignettes, move and rotate a vignette or adjust the feather size and fall off. However, the app doesn’t let you take photos, which means that all images you want to edit have to be imported from the camera roll. The Final Touch also offers a number of preset vignettes you can easily apply to a photo and customize in any way you want. After you’ve completed the vignetting process, you can share a photo to your social media accounts directly from the app.

Tap on the **Pencil icon** to access the app’s **Tool menu**, select the **Vignette option** and then proceed to adjust the **Outer and Inner Brightness** sliders. This will enable you to precisely define how dark you want the photo’s edges to be or how bright the central part of the picture is. To change the size of the vignette you just have to pinch in or out on the phone’s screen and **Center Size option** will appear near the bottom of the screen. Tap on the **Save button** once you’re happy with the results and then hit **Export** to create a copy of the photo that contains the changes you’ve made.

Besides being a powerful photo editor, the VSCO app is also a community of photography enthusiasts where you can discover inspiring work or connect with like-minded people. The app also features a collection of effects that enable you to recreate the look of vintage film produced by **Kodak, Fuji or Agfa.** Despite remarkably powerful photo editing options, VSCO is far from a perfect choice if you want to add a vignette to your photo since it only offers **basic vignetting tools**. You can add a vignette to a photo the same way you’d apply any other effect, but you won’t have access to advanced feathering options. iPhone and Android users in need of an app that lets them shoot and edit photos and videos should give VSCO a chance. Keep in mind that video editing options are only available if you purchase the VSCO X Membership.

Just tap on the Vignette icon to create the effect and then proceed to adjust the settings.

**Conclusion**

Making the edges of a photo darker can without a doubt make your photos stand out, but falling in love with vignettes and using this effect excessively is not necessarily a great idea. Using vignettes in your photos subtly so they aren’t easy to notice will probably create the best results. Which iPhone or Android vignette app do you use to edit your photos?

## Part 2 Difference Between Aspect Ratio and Resolution

Aspect ratio and resolution are interrelated and go hand-in-hand. For a certain aspect ratio, there is several counterparts’ resolution that can be used. While the aspect ratio defines the width and the height relationship, the resolution is the number of pixels on the screen.

To obtain the resolution of a video, you will multiply the height by the width while for the aspect ratio, width is divided by the height. When the height is multiplied by its width times, the results you get represent the square pixels of your screen and this number dented the quality of the video. The higher the pixels, the higher will be the video quality.
