## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

## **Part 5: Best Alternative to Final Cut Express**

Now, as Final Cut Express is no longer available, you may want to try the other two editors of Apple. While iMovie mainly targeted beginners, Final Cut Express and Pro targeted users with moderate to advanced knowledge of video editing.

For those beginners who wanted to make professional-looking videos without any editing skills, Wondershare launched Filmora as an alternative to Final Cut Express and Pro.

This user-friendly made video editing as simple as ABC. From offering multiple hand-picked effects to advanced editing options, Filmora allows you to range markers, perfect your audio, group timeline clips, and perform detailed color correction with auto-correction and color wheels for free.

**Key Features**

* Advanced video editing options;
* 300+ free handcrafted effects
* User-friendly video editing tools; and
* Video conversion options to multiple formats.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.

To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003\. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.

![Final-Cut-Express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Final-Cut-Express.png)

However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.

Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.

## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

This user-friendly made video editing as simple as ABC. From offering multiple hand-picked effects to advanced editing options, Filmora allows you to range markers, perfect your audio, group timeline clips, and perform detailed color correction with auto-correction and color wheels for free.

**Key Features**

* Advanced video editing options;
* 300+ free handcrafted effects
* User-friendly video editing tools; and
* Video conversion options to multiple formats.

## Part 4: Tips for Creating Stop Motion Videos for Instagram

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video. Developing a concept will enable you to know which props you are going to need or how many actors you have to find before you can actually start shooting.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos.

### 1\. Develop a concept

 What is your stop motion video about? This is the first and the most important question you will have to answer before you start making a stop motion video.

### 2\. Shoot in studio conditions

 Although it is not impossible to make a stop motion video in outdoor conditions, having control over sudden light changes is. That is why it is much better to shoot stop motion videos in studio-like conditions where you can easily adjust all the parameters in accordance with the demands of the project you’re working on. In addition, it is paramount to keep your phone perfectly steady, which is why it is better to mount it on a tripod than to shoot handheld.

**Conclusion**

 Instagram’s stop motion feature is still under development and it may be some time before you can use it to create professional-looking videos. Apps like Over or Life Lapse are a much better option for all video content creators who would like to impress their audience with stop motion videos.

As for merging videos, much like Fastreel, Clideo is pretty straightforward. You just click on the mentioned tool, and then easily choose files you would like to combine – you can merge any amount of video clips there. Several files can be chosen at the same time, or they can be added one by one.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-6.jpg)

Then it will take you to the editor, where you can join the videos. It’s possible to rearrange the files, by using drag-and-drop until they're in the desired order. You can also add images and set duration from them, add audio, change its length and volume. The last step is choosing the aspect ratio and clicking the Export button. You can watch the preview of your result and then click on Download if you are satisfied with the merged file.

* **Typito**

[Typito](https://typito.com/) is a platform to merge videos online, as well as Fastreel and Clideo. It is free, and mostly aims to create combinations one can use to post on social network such as Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. Typito supports a great many formats, some of them being MP4, AVI, FLV and WMV. You can edit your videos before merging them by trimming, cropping and resizing, and also add transition effects and music. It quickly combines footage, doesn’t watermark the videos, has brand kit of colors, fonts and style. It can also create collection of images, which is used for making Youtube compilation at most times.

To merge videos, you should choose the tool, then Get Started, and register and sign in first.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-8.jpg)

Then click on New Project, choose a video format (the platform offers you the list of the most popular ones), and it will take you to the editor, where you start off by adding media.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-9.jpg)

Drag and drop images or videos that you want to combine into a single video. You can also click to upload media files from your system or browse our Stock Media library for high-quality stock photos and video. Then, you can put your video clips in order, and work on it, if you want to use different tools, such as: edit, crop, trim, or resize them, as well as add text captions, images, and transitions. After you have previewed your video, you can click on the export button in the top right corner, and then, your merged video will be ready to be shared.

* **Online UniConverter**

Online UniConverter is the next online platform giving us the chance to merge our videos without watermark. It is an online analogue of Wondershare UniConverter, and is a very powerful platform, where you can trim, split, rotate, adjust, and download videos in HD quality. UniConverter supports numerous video formats, including MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, WEBM. Online UniConverter offers various transitions and aspect ratios to fit the screen.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-10.jpg)

The web-site has lots of tools and features to offer: in the description of it, it reads: video converter, video compressor, video editor, audio converter, audio compressor, audio cutter, GIF maker, YouTube thumbnail, and image resizer. Importing media to the online UniConverter is extremely easy, and combining videos turns out to be a quick process, too.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-11.jpg)

Anyway, if you want to combine a lot of files and the size of them all exceeds 100 MB, you will not be able to use Online Uniconverter for that. It supports the video no more than 100 MB and suggests using Wondershare UniConverter (originally Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate) for Desktop.

* **Wondershare Filmora**

Last but not least – [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ! Even it differs from other abovementioned video mergers, as in it is not totally free and adds a Filmora logo on exported project, it’s a great suggestion for people who want to make their videos look great with the help of various tools. When a user is ready to pay, Filmora offers a subscription model, and for a bit more, one can get a permanent license. The software costs $51.99 per year or $79.99 for an outright purchase (prices are regularly discounted).

Wondershare Filmora has a clear and pleasing interface, offers trimming, transitions, overlays, several effects, as well as some more advanced and modern features, such as motion tracking. For this one particular software, we will be offering a step by step guide about how to merge videos there.

* We can click and drag, essentially, "insert" a video in a sequence below. The Linear Timeline allows us to understand exactly when a video clip ends and when a new one starts.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-14.jpg)

* Accordingly, we can make one video "sit" next to another. If we want or need it, we will add the third video clip, fourth, and so on.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-15.jpg)

* In the opened window, on the left side, to be precise, if we observe well, we can already choose in which format we want to save our clip. On the right we can indicate what name we want to give to our video; The location where we want to store it; Also, we see the resolution (which we can modify freely after clicking on Settings); Size; Duration.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-17.jpg)

* In Settings, we can decide how much quality the video should have, how many kbps will be the Bit Rate, how many fps the Frame Rate should be, etc., but most likely, beginners will not need to change all this.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-18.jpg)

* After selecting everything, right-click on the Export button in the lower right corner of the window and the program will start saving the material.
