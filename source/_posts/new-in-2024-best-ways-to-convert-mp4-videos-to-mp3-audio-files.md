Avidemux is a free, open-source video editing program with a clear interface, so enhancing video quality is easy with Avidemux.

The best thing about Avidemux when it comes to the top video quality enhancers is that it supports a lot of file formats. From FLV to MKV, AVI, WMV, MOV, OGM, MPEG, and MP4, Avidemux lets you enhance the quality of any file format easily. The multithreading option is also a great feature - and possibly the program's finest advantage.

However, there is no timeline, creative effects, or transitions to enhance the video.

Premiere Pro CC enables you to turn the raw footage captured by any camera in any format into awe-inspiring videos. Besides offering superb video editing options that include powerful color correction tools and amazing effects, the software also offers a decent amount of audio editing options.

This video editing software lets you do virtually anything if you know how to do it. Multicam editing, a rich selection of effects, or support for a wide array of video file formats make Lightworks an excellent choice for skilled video editing professionals.

Even though the free version of the software is available, buying a monthly or annual license is a much better option if you want to approach your next project professionally.
