Finding suitable video editing software is quite a difficult task. There are so many choices and at the present scenario, loads of tools come for free even.

Here is a list of top five free WMV video editing tools, which feature almost all sorts of casual video editing needs.

If you need a more professional video editing tool, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is highly recommended.
