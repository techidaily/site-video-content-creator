### How to cut 3gp file with Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)

#### 1\.  Add 3GP files to Wondershare 3GP cutting tool

There are two different ways for you to add 3GP files to this 3GP splitter. Hit the “Import” button on the main menu of the interface to browse your computer and then import your wanted 3GP files to this app’s album. Or you can also add your files by directly dragging and dropping them into this app’s album.

#### 2 Cut 3GP video clips

Drag one of the source 3GP files from the album to the timeline at the bottom. And then move the top of the red Time Indicator to put it at one point you want, click the scissor-like icon, move the Time Indicator to another point, and hit the scissor icon again. In this way, you can split the 3GP file into several clips.

If you want to chop a big 3GP file into several small-size files, at this time, you need to save the whole project for backup purpose. Then, import the saved project again and again to delete redundant clips to just export the only one into a single file each time.

But if you want to cut out some unwanted segments or to extract some parts you want, just hit the clips you don’t want and click the “Delete” icon.
