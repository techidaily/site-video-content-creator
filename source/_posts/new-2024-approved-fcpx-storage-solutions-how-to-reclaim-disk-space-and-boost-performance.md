### 1\. Wondershare Filmora for Mac\[for beginner and intermediate\]

[**Filmora for Mac**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is suitable for all i.e., beginners, intermediate, and advanced video editors who want to utilize all the professional options yet need a simple interface.  And given this smooth shift from beginners to experts — we recommend Filmora to the beginners and intermediate users who want to make a career or follow their passion for video-editing for years to come.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Coming to the features, Filmora includes all that is needed to enhance the video clips’ quality and give it unique and personalized effects.

### 2\. [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)\[for professionals\]

![Final Cut Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lumafusion-for-mac-fcp.jpg)

Apple’s native Final Cut Pro X is another perfect alternative that has managed to make the top list when it comes to the best video editing software for the Mac since its release in 2011\. And although it’s a pricey option, Final Cut Pro X offers a 90-day trial period to judge the application for yourself. Of course, the trial version excludes some additional content like extra sound effects, presets, the space designer plugin, and advanced video formats. Still, it should be enough to review the application.

Coming to the features, Final Cut Pro X takes things to a different level and offers you the best-in-trade functions to edit the videos to perfection. Including superior organization tools, libraries, ratings, tagging, auto analysis for faces, scenes — the interface of Final Cut Pro X speaks of the effort the designers have put into the software. Moreover, the multi-cam support, multiple later editing, audio effects, and the recent upgrade of smoothing 360-degree footage and HDR modes have shown that Apple will leave no stone unturned when it comes to perfecting its native professional video-editing tool, i.e., Final Cut Pro X.

However, there is a learning curve if you are new to Final Cut Pro X (regardless of whether you are an expert or not), as it incorporates a unique magnetic, trackless timeline that is not common to the video-editing software. But that initial learning time is worth it because once you start utilizing Final Cut Pro X, you will not see (or like) any other software in the industry — given the regular and timely updates to the application.

### 2\. [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)\[for professionals\]

![Final Cut Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lumafusion-for-mac-fcp.jpg)

Apple’s native Final Cut Pro X is another perfect alternative that has managed to make the top list when it comes to the best video editing software for the Mac since its release in 2011\. And although it’s a pricey option, Final Cut Pro X offers a 90-day trial period to judge the application for yourself. Of course, the trial version excludes some additional content like extra sound effects, presets, the space designer plugin, and advanced video formats. Still, it should be enough to review the application.

Coming to the features, Final Cut Pro X takes things to a different level and offers you the best-in-trade functions to edit the videos to perfection. Including superior organization tools, libraries, ratings, tagging, auto analysis for faces, scenes — the interface of Final Cut Pro X speaks of the effort the designers have put into the software. Moreover, the multi-cam support, multiple later editing, audio effects, and the recent upgrade of smoothing 360-degree footage and HDR modes have shown that Apple will leave no stone unturned when it comes to perfecting its native professional video-editing tool, i.e., Final Cut Pro X.

However, there is a learning curve if you are new to Final Cut Pro X (regardless of whether you are an expert or not), as it incorporates a unique magnetic, trackless timeline that is not common to the video-editing software. But that initial learning time is worth it because once you start utilizing Final Cut Pro X, you will not see (or like) any other software in the industry — given the regular and timely updates to the application.

### 5  Movavi Video Editor

**Supported System**: Window, macOS

**Pricing:** Free trial

Movavi is a video editing program with a straightforward, user-friendly interface. PiP, chroma-key, titling, adding music to video, basic keyframing, and motion tracking are all included. It isn't as feature-rich or speedy as some competitors, but it allows you to create appealing work quickly.

It's time to begin the post-production procedure when your video capture is finished, and your newly obtained film has been safely transferred from your camcorder to a hard disk. You may alter the audio file of your short video in any manner you like with the Movavi video editor.

**Step 1:** From the welcome box, choose to **Create a projec**t in full feature mode. When you're in the editor, click the **Add Media Files** button to incorporate the video and audio files you want to utilize in your new project.

**Step 2:** Every file you choose will be instantly placed on the Movavi timeline, with video files will appear on the Video Track and audio files on the **Audio Track**. To eliminate the unnecessary section of the audio file, click the **Split** option.

**Step 3**: Simply press **Start** and wait for your movie to be exported after selecting the correct video format and setting the destination folder by deciding on the **Save to** section.

**Conclusion**

Any video without some background soundtrack or any music, in general, appears to be at its 50% percent. Users tend to lose interest soon if they don't have something playing in the background all the time.

This is why the best Video Editor with Music reviewed in this article will ultimately do everything for you. From editing your videos and pictures, these apps are tailored to provide excellent functionality to any user. Decide on the one you liked based on the features and treat yourself to the best!
