Click "Add videos and photos" to browse and select videos and photos from your computer to add. You can also drag and drop videos and photos to the storyboard.

### Step 2\. Split videos in Windows Live Movie Maker

There are two ways to use Windows Live Movie Maker split function: 1\. Choose the video point where you want to split, right-click the video clip, and click "split". 2\. Select the video point you will split. Under "Video Tools", click the "Edit" tab, and then click the "split" button.

After that, your video will be split into separate sections. And you can edit separate videos as you like and drag and drop to move the location.

### Step 3\. Save and share your videos

Click the icon at the top left, then choose Save movie. There are four output video qualities to choose from. When you place your mouse cursor on each option, you can see the output video display size, aspect ratio, etc. You can also burn the videos to DVD by clicking Burn a DVD item and select a destination folder to save your video file.
