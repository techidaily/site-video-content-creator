The modern age comes with modern problems, dealing with broadcast and streaming platforms and their formatting regulation can be less of a hassle with apps like Compressor. With Compressor, you can export multiple files in different formats, all at once.

 **Is Compressor included with Final Cut Pro?**

Final Cut Pro X is a dedicated editing and fine-tuning software that includes tools for audio editing and color correction. Two apps are added to complement its arsenal of features, they include:

* Motion 5 for professional motion graphics.
* Compressor 4 for advanced media encoding.

Both apps are on sale in there the Mac App Store. These apps are designed to give users more flexibility in efficiently carrying out projects.

How to send renders to Compressor

 ![destenations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/destenations.png)

Part 1:

Step one: The first step is to access the Compressor preference. In the section, “My Computer” all you need to do is turn on “Allow other computers to process batches on my computer.”

 Step 2:

Next, you have to click on the “Shared Computers” option and click the plus button. You can find it in the lower-left area.

 Step 3:

To make the process effective, you have to repeat this simple process on all the computers you want to add to the render farm within your network. Note: they need to have Compressor installed.

 Step 4:

This step entails that you rename titles set as “Untitled” or something relatable or easy to remember.

 Step 5:

Next, you can click on that group to view all your computers within your network with sharing enabled. Furthermore, you can also check for more computers that you may want to add.

 Step 6:

When you add a file to be transcoded, look for the “Process On” button, you can find it on the lower right. Select the drop-down option to view your complete group.

 Step 7:

To begin, you can select your present group. Next, click the “Start Batch” option. This should begin the process.

 Note: if you have the FCPX 10.1.3 and Compressor 4.1 version installed, the above-explained feature will not be enabled within FCPX utilizing the Send to Compressor feature. If you go ahead with its anyway, your group will be greyed, therefore preventing it from being selected.

Compressor is a powerful tool integrated with final cut pro. Any professionals who care about the final presentation of their videos should take a look at Compressor.

## FCPX Tutorial: Image Cropping Made Easy

# Final Cut Pro X: How to Crop an Image

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don't want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you'll learn in this article.

---

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Crop an Image in Final Cut Pro X

However, before I show how this is done, I need to explain one really important fact about video: all video uses what's called "fixed resolution." Fixed resolution means that high-definition video is always displayed at one of two sizes:

**You May Also Like:** [How to Crop GIF Images >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* 1920 x 1080 pixels
* 1920 x 1080 pixels

Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don't like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.

I'll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called "trimming") and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called "cropping"). You get to pick which one works the best for you.

#### TRIMMING

Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop001.jpg)

For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (<www.pond5.com>). Let's say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop002.jpg)

The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose "Crop."

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop003.jpg)

This displays the cropping tools in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop004.jpg)

Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I'll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop005.jpg)

Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.

NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop006.jpg)

Drag other corners or edges to further trim the image.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop007.jpg)

When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the "Done" button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop008.jpg)

If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop009.jpg)

But, it actually isn't black, it's transparent. If you put another clip below it, you'll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.

Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.

#### CROPPING

Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.

There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop010.jpg)

* Click the Crop icon, as we illustrated above

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop011.jpg)

* Right-mouse click (or Control-click) inside the Viewer and choose
* Type Shift+C

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop012.jpg)

\* In the Inspector > Video tab > Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop013.jpg)

If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop014.jpg)

Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.

Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop015.jpg)

Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop016.jpg)

When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop017.jpg)

Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don't see it.

And, if you look closely, you'll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.

#### RESET

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop018.jpg)

To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word "Crop."

#### SUMMARY

Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.

Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don't crop too much.

I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.

Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.

#### CROPPING

Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.

There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop010.jpg)

* Click the Crop icon, as we illustrated above

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop011.jpg)

* Right-mouse click (or Control-click) inside the Viewer and choose
* Type Shift+C

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop012.jpg)

\* In the Inspector > Video tab > Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop013.jpg)

If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop014.jpg)

Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.

Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop015.jpg)

Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop016.jpg)

When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop017.jpg)

Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don't see it.

And, if you look closely, you'll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.

#### RESET

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop018.jpg)

To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word "Crop."

#### SUMMARY

Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.

Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don't crop too much.

I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.

Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don't want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you'll learn in this article.

## How to Crop an Image in Final Cut Pro X

However, before I show how this is done, I need to explain one really important fact about video: all video uses what's called "fixed resolution." Fixed resolution means that high-definition video is always displayed at one of two sizes:

**You May Also Like:** [How to Crop GIF Images >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* 1920 x 1080 pixels
* 1920 x 1080 pixels

Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don't like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.

I'll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called "trimming") and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called "cropping"). You get to pick which one works the best for you.

#### TRIMMING

Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop001.jpg)

For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (<www.pond5.com>). Let's say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop002.jpg)

The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose "Crop."

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop003.jpg)

This displays the cropping tools in the Viewer.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop004.jpg)

Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I'll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop005.jpg)

Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.

NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop006.jpg)

Drag other corners or edges to further trim the image.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop007.jpg)

When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the "Done" button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop008.jpg)

If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.

![how to crop an image with final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop009.jpg)

But, it actually isn't black, it's transparent. If you put another clip below it, you'll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.

# How to Fix Plugins Not Working in Final Cut Pro X?

**Final Cut Pro X** is one of the most reliable, versatile, and powerful video editing tools. What really makes it more powerful and useful for video editors is the hundreds of third-party plugins that can be easily added to the program.

With these plugins, creative masters can add astonishing video effects and enhance their quality effortlessly. While these plugins have several advantages, they can also create trouble for the users by acting up and not working properly.

With the rising demand for Final Cut Pro X, the malfunction of these plugins is also rife causing frustration among users. Therefore, in this blog post, we have listed a few common causes of failure of these plugins and how to fix this breakdown, glitch or non-working.

Well, you may want to find more free plugins, [see it here.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Why Are Plugins Not Working in Final Cut Pro X?

Those who are beginner-level video editors should know what exactly these plugins are about and how they can add value to the videos. These plugins are additional components that have the capability to expand the abilities of an application. By letting users do exciting things and additional video edits, users can impress their audience using transitions and other exciting video effects. But these advantages can be handy only when the plugins come into use. If they are not in working condition or have crashed, they will be of benefit to the users or the video editors.

![top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-alex-4d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-alex-4d.jpg)

Here are a few common reasons due to which your plugin may be working partially or completely crashing.

* Inappropriate configuration or settings of the Final Cut Pro X
* Conflict with the plugin template
* Incorrect code of the plugin by rookie developers
* Incompatibility with the latest version of Final Cut Pro
* Incomplete installation of the plugin

Among the many reasons for plugin malfunction, one of the most common ones in incorrect or bad code. After all, nobody is protected from rookie developers as they can come with strange codes, causing plugin crashing problems. It is not the user’s mistake if the code is incorrect. Therefore, you should simply consider taking advice from the help center of the plugin site or ask any of their experts to settle the matter.

In addition to this, the plugins are constantly updating by the developers therefore users willing to install the latest plugins should first see whether the plugin is compatible with their Final Cut Pro X version or not. If you do not have the latest version of the software, there are chances that the plugin can crash. You should then consider contacting the expert or simply installing the latest version of the plugin that is best supported by the Final Cut Pro X.

If your plugin does not work, it may be likely due to the aforementioned reasons and causes. But fixing this issue is mandatory therefore, in the next section we have covered a few troubleshooting tips to fix plugins that keep crashing or are malfunctioning.

Well, it's time to introduce another powerful editing tool, Filmora. It's friendly for beginners and you can always find various resources in the library inside!

## How to Fix Plugins Not Working in Final Cut Pro X?

Imagine using Final Cut Pro latest version and downloading some new transitions for your video, but they display crashed or malfunctioned or do not appear the way you want them to be. This can be really frustrating and upsetting for the user especially when they have to prepare the edited video in a short time.

![color-finale-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-color-finale-2.jpg)

Fortunately, there are easy ways to fix the problem when they are not properly working inside the Final Cut Pro X. Generally, the issue can be fixed by simply updating and re-installing the plugin in your system but if that does not work, consider the below checklist of the elements you should consider fixing the problems related to the generators, effects, transitions, and titles inside the Final Cut Pro X.

* **Searching on the Correct Part** \- When looking for the plugin, you should always ensure looking for it in the correct part of the Final Cut Pro X. For instance, if you are looking for the effects, make sure that you are checking them in the effects panel.
* **Proper Installation** \- The next tip that you must consider is the correct and proper installation of the plugin. You should follow the steps of the plugin installation in order to avoid incorrect installation in your Final Cut Pro X.
* **Localization of the Folders** \- Now comes the localization of the folders meaning their placement. You should ensure keeping your motion effects, templates, generators, transitions, and titles folders localized.
* **Placement of the Effects and Transitions** \- While placing your titles and generators, you should ensure that they go on the top of your timeline however the transitions can go in between the two clips on the timeline and the effects can be dropped directly into the video clip.
* **Delete the Plugin from Everywhere** \- You should always consider deleting the plugin from everywhere in your system if it continues to trouble you. Delete it from the finder and trash folders, then re-download, re-install and restart your system.
* **Seek Help from the Plugin Creator** \- If none of the aforementioned tips helps, you should definitely turn to the service provider or the plugin creator who can offer you their expert assistance.

All those video editors who are specifically getting a red warning error sign inside the Final Cut Pro X software should understand that there is a problem with the actual file instead of the plugin. So, try fixing that in the first place.

## Final Thoughts

Final Cut Pro X is a helpful software tool and provided with such effective plugins, it can create really impressive videos for the audience. But several users complain regarding plugin malfunction issues which can be resolved following the listed tips in this blog post. Reach out to experts if the issue remains unsettled even after implementing the discussed methods.
