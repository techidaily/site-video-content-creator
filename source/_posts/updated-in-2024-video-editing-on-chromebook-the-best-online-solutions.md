 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

The increase in popularity of Chromebooks, over the past several years is more than justified because these devices have proven that they are much more than just a web-browsing tool. Using a Chromebook for educational purposes or to widen your network of business associates is becoming more common, while new upgrades of the OS bring improvements at an astounding rate.

However, editing visual content isn't that easy for Chromebook users, because Windows or Mac applications can't be used that easily on these devices. That is the reason why online video editors play a large role for all Chromebook owners who want to create videos that meet at least some of the professional standards. Luckily, currently, there is a large number of online video editors available that can offer a solid video editing experience to users who would like to piece their video clips together into visually attractive content.

## Best Online Video Editors for Chromebook

In such abundance of different online video editors, most Chromebook owners will find themselves wondering, which online video editor is the best for me. Although the answer to this question will depend on the user's need and the reasons why they want to create a video, it is safe to say that the online video editors listed in this article are among the best that are currently available on the Internet. Let's have a look at some of the best online video editors that will help you create visually engaging videos.

#### 2.[Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

![Magisto Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magisto-upload.jpg)

**Price:** Starts at $2,49 per month and goes up to $39,99 per month

**What we like:** Creates high-quality videos and it uses artificial intelligence to help its users produce better videos.

**What we don't like:** Premium and professional pricing plans have video duration limits

Assembling a great video has been made easy with this online video editor. Creating a video with the Magisto online video editor can be completed in three simple steps. Upload your photos or videos, select the video editing style that best reflects the type of video you want to create, select the music from the editor's music library and let the A.I. video maker analyze the images and create the video you want. With Magisto there is no need to spend countless hours editing your business videos, however different pricing plans offer different amounts of options. The pricing plan for Marketers that comes at $39,99 per month allows its users to create video optimized for branding and advertising.

This pricing plan doesn't have any restrictions regarding the duration of the videos, while Professional and Premium pricing plans limit users to movies that last from 2:30 up to 4:00 minutes. The owners of the Marketers version of this online video editor can use the editor's stock footage collection that contains over 100,000 videos, and in addition, they can create videos in Facebook or YouTube styles.

#### 3.[Loopster](http://www.loopster.com/)

![Loopster Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loopster-online-video-editor.jpg)

**Price:** Pricing plans range from $4,99 per month to $129 billed every three months

**What we like:** A large amount of storage space for videos on the cloud

**What we don't like:** Loopster offers a very limited amount of transitions and other video editing tools, and you have to pay before using

Loopster's functional and yet smart design makes this video online editor easy to use. Even the people who haven't edited a video in their lives can learn how to use this remarkable video editor in a short period of time. Loopster offers a lot of storage space to its members, but the maximum file size users can upload is limited to 2GB. Depending on the price package users can have access to 20 or 30-minute timelines, which limits the possibilities of users who would like to produce longer videos. Even though a number of visual effects offered by Loopster isn't as big as some users could expect, the online video editor enables them to slow down or speed up videos up to five times.

The owners of Movie Producer Membership, Education, and Business packages have access to over 600 sound effects, while all packages allow users to add text and graphics to the images they are processing. The maximum video resolution this online video editor can produce is 1080p, regardless of the pricing plan, but if you opt to use the free version of Loopster, the maximum video resolution is 480p. Even though Loopster provides only basic video editing options it is still one of the best choices as an online video editor for Chromebook users.

Using Animatron Wave is an efficient way to cut video production expenses and maintain the same level of quality of the videos that tell the story of your brand.

**Price:** From $29,99 to 299,99 depending on the pricing plan

**What we like:** Kizoa offers a lot of different transitions and effects

**What we don't like:** Editor's timeline could be better organized

The editor offers the 4K video editing support, although this feature isn't available with the free version of the editor. Kizoa can be purchased with several different pricing plans and you must only purchase it once and you gain the lifetime membership for one one of the best online video editors for Chromebook.

#### 6.[PowToon](https://www.powtoon.com/)

![PowToon Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/powtoon.jpg)

**Price:** Free Trial, $19/month - $59/month

**What we like:** Makes animating videos easy

**What we don't like:** Pricey
