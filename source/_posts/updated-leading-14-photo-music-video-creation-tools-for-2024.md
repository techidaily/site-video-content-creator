## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.

## Part2: How to Do Motion Blur in Easy Way?

The motion needs a sufficient amount of blur. It happens with our natural perception as well. For example, if something moves too quickly, it appears blur to our eyes. So, it must be the right amount of blur.

To tackle this problem, we add motion blur to make it look more natural and reality based. It provides the natural smearing we see when something moves too quickly but not when shooting the video. To add this effect, you can use powerful editing software such as Wondershare Filmora. Follow the below steps to add a blur effect to your video on Filmora.

## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.

Don’t worry if you are a beginner and don’t have the advanced skills to create a video slideshow. There are multiple websites like Canva where you build amazing slideshows for free and impress your family and friends. Given below are simple steps to create video slideshows online.

## Part 6: How to make a simple Slideshow Free & Online?

1. First of all, log in to your Canva account using Gmail or Facebook and open a new page. Search for your desired Slideshow design.
2. Find your favorite template by using the search tool. Select a template you want to add to your video slideshow and move to the next step.
3. Go to the Canva’s library where you can find a variety of charts, images, photos, icons, and illustrations. To add any of these graphics to your page, use the Drag and Drop tool. For clear images, use the photo effects tool.
4. Now, select all the images and illustrations you want and customize your slideshow using background, sound effects, font style, animations, color scheme, and animated sticker GIFs.
5. Once you have finished the customization, preview your slideshow and make sure everything looks perfect. If you are happy with the result, download the slideshow in MP4, PPT JPEG, PDF, PNG, or any other format as per your requirement. For live telecast, press the Present button or share the link on your Facebook or Instagram account.

**Conclusion**

If you want to impress your family and friends with your video-editing skills, there’s no better option than creating an impressive video slideshow. You can give a pleasant surprise to your siblings or astonish your loved ones by making a video slideshow of their memorable images.

Several video-editing tools are available where you can design, edit, and recreate innovative video slideshows.

You just have to simply import all images, arrange them in proper order, choose your favorite theme or template, and add transitions and audio effects, and download the slideshow in your desired format.

You can also use online tools like Canva to create amazing video slideshows online for free. Try Wondershare Filmora X if you are looking for quality, simplicity, and pricing flexibility.
