 **To fix this issue, the first thing you should do is update your graphics driver.** There are two ways that you can update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.
