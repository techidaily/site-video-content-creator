---

 This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Use the following Adobe Premiere tips to make your video editing easier and save time and energy. Make the process much easier than you had thought.

## Useful Adobe Premiere Pro and Elements tips

#### 1. Change the default settings

 You can save some time on video editing by changing two default settings: Scale Media to Project Size and Default Picture Length. You can go to Edit > Preferences > General to find the two settings. Scale Media to Project Size means any photo or video will be scaled down to the project size. This setting will save you a lot of time especially when you are mixing a lot of SD and HD video and photos. Default Picture Length originally is set at 150 frames or five seconds of footage. You can change it to any set mount so that you don't need to adjust every photo you import. When you finished the settings changing, hit "OK" to save.

#### 2.Capture video clips from your camcorder directly

 Remember that you don't need to transfer your camcorder videos to your hard drive first and then import the video clips to Adobe Premiere. When you have connected your camcorder or other video capture devices to your computer, set the camcorder to playback or set it in VCR mode. Then, in Adobe Premiere, start a new project and go to File > Capture to import your media from your camcorder directly. This will save your some time for Adobe Premiere video editing.

#### 3. Keep your project more organized with "Bins"

 You can click the "Folder" icon in the "Project" window to create a new folder to store video clips or other things. Store them in many different folders rather than only one so that you can find what you want more quickly. Create bins for storing separate audio, video, photo, etc. This Adobe Premiere tip will definitely makes your project more organized and can save time for editing.

#### 4. Create personalized video transitions

 When adding transition effects to videos, you can make some adjustments to the transition effects to make them more personalized. You can locate the transition effects in the "Effects" tab. And in the "Effect Controls" tab, you adjust the transitions such as changing the duration time, changing the entrance animation, etc.

#### 5. Choose the most suitable output video format

 Take the output video quality to consideration when creating a new project in Adobe Premier. For example, if you just want to share the videos on YouTube, then you don't need to create HD videos because it will take you much more time to upload the videos to Internet if they're HD videos. Besides, the HD videos also need much more storage space. Get the smaller video size with better compression and easily share your videos on Web.

#### 6. Quick render

 In Adobe Premiere, most effects and videos render in real time. To have a full preview of all the effects, you can press "Enter", which will render the project and enables you to preview the overall video effect in the "Monitor" window.

 Tip: Adobe Premiere is a very professional video editor and costs a lot. For a video editing beginner, it's better turn to some easy-to-use yet powerful video editor, say [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which can help you burn to DVD directly and share to YouTube in several click. If you don't want to spend any money on video editing, you can also turn to some free video editing software like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie.
