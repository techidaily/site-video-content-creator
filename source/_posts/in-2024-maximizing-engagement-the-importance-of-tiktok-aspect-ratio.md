### 3\. Generated Photos Face Generator

Website: [](https://generated.photos/face-generator)<https://generated.photos/face-generator>

This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.

![generated photos face generator online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/generated-photos-face-generator-online.jpg)

You can then download the generated photo by signing up or logging in, but you need to pay to remove the watermark.

### 4\. Massless

**Website:** [https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai](https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/)

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

* Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., **Nose**).
* Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., **Nose**), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.
* Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.
* Click **Download images** from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.

### 5\. This Person Does Not Exist

**Website:** <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/>

This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.

You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:

* Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;
* Click **Another** from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.
* Click **Save image** from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.

**Note:** Different browsers may have this feature with other names

![thispersondoesnotexist free online face generators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thispersondoesnotexist-free-online-face-generators.jpg)

### 6\. BoredHumans

**Website**: <https://boredhumans.com/faces.php>

This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.

You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:

* Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click **Generate Another Fake Human** if you don’t like the one that appears;
* Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the **Generate A Human** button to create a less realistic image of a random person.

![free online face generators boredhumans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-boredhumans.jpg)

* Right-click the image and click **Save image** to download the photo to your PC; and then get to the default download location to access the photo and use it wherever needed.

### 7\. faceMaker

**Website**: <https://facemaker.uvrg.org/>

faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.

You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:

* Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click **Start** from the main page.
* Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.
* Click **Start** and then click **Continue** on the next page. Use the sliders on the left and right panels to customize the face as needed, and once done, you can use any screen capturing tool to take a snapshot and remove the sliders by cropping the image, thus having only the virtual face.

![free online face generators facemaker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-facemaker.jpg)

* Save the cropped photo on your PC, and then back on the webpage, click **Finished** from the bottom-right corner.

![facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

* On the next page, choose the radio buttons according to your choice. Once done, click **Yes, submit now** from the bottom to submit the customized virtual face to the portal.

![download facemaker online face generators face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-facemaker-online-face-generators-face.jpg)

**Conclusion**

With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.

## Part 3: What are the limitations when using Sony Vegas (Vegas Pro) on Mac?

Yes, with the given **Sony Vegas alternatives, Mac** and Windows users can benefit heavily. But why is it important to try for a replacement when Sony Vegas Pro is relatively efficient software?

To know the answer, you should take the time to understand its limitations, which do exist.

#### **It only works for Windows users**

The Sony Vegas Pro software is not available for Mac or other operating systems besides Windows. In addition, it’ll be really complex and time-consuming, even if you opt for virtual machine software or handle dual booting techniques to configure the software on your Mac or Linux.

#### **You need to invest in other hardware**

Sony Vegas Pro does do not work within one comprehensive platform like other capable video editing software types, like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You have to acquire a powerful PC and tools to operate it separately. The software works very slowly on older devices.

#### **Not incredibly unique**

The functions of Sony Vegas Pro match somewhat with other options in the market. So, users would not expect much value in purchasing this software’s plans that they want to upgrade from their previous system, but on the other hand, the available features are mostly standard-level in functionality as well.

## Hot FAQs about Vegas Pro Alternatives

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy. However, Filmora has a cohesive ecosystem with rich AI and standard functions and comes with Mac/Windows support. So, in that sense, Filmora is comparatively a better choice.

## Part 3: What are the limitations when using Sony Vegas (Vegas Pro) on Mac?

Yes, with the given **Sony Vegas alternatives, Mac** and Windows users can benefit heavily. But why is it important to try for a replacement when Sony Vegas Pro is relatively efficient software?

To know the answer, you should take the time to understand its limitations, which do exist.

#### **It only works for Windows users**

The Sony Vegas Pro software is not available for Mac or other operating systems besides Windows. In addition, it’ll be really complex and time-consuming, even if you opt for virtual machine software or handle dual booting techniques to configure the software on your Mac or Linux.

#### **You need to invest in other hardware**

Sony Vegas Pro does do not work within one comprehensive platform like other capable video editing software types, like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You have to acquire a powerful PC and tools to operate it separately. The software works very slowly on older devices.

#### **Not incredibly unique**

The functions of Sony Vegas Pro match somewhat with other options in the market. So, users would not expect much value in purchasing this software’s plans that they want to upgrade from their previous system, but on the other hand, the available features are mostly standard-level in functionality as well.

## Hot FAQs about Vegas Pro Alternatives

After knowing these details, many users still have specific common queries about opting for a Sony Vegas Pro alternatively. So these are some common FAQs about this- answered.

#### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

No, it is impossible to directly use Sony Vegas on macOS devices since it does not support it. Instead, you have to separately use a dual boot strategy or virtual machine software to activate the video editor on Mac devices, but the process for that is complex.

#### 2\. Is Wondershare Filmora or Vegas Pro better?

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Vegas Pro are top-level options in video and audio editing projects with professional-level editing accuracy. However, Filmora has a cohesive ecosystem with rich AI and standard functions and comes with Mac/Windows support. So, in that sense, Filmora is comparatively a better choice.

## Final Words

In place of Sony Vegas Pro, any of these options would also give you a great user experience. Out of them, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one that we will recommend due to its multi-faceted benefits and features for Mac and Windows users. Ultimately, make your decision based on your particular needs.
