Besides offering the option to edit vertical videos, the platform enables its users to crop or resize their videos, [add emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to them, or change the color of the video’s background.

However, you should keep in mind that you cannot create videos that are longer than ten minutes with this online video editor. Blurbiz.io supports only a handful of [video file formats](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and you need to make sure that the video you want to edit is saved in either MP4, MOV, FLV, WEBM, or AVI format.

You can only download the content you create with Blurbiz.io to your computer as the video editor doesn’t have file-sharing options.

**Pros**

* Powerful video editing options
* No watermark
* Allows users to export files in 720p or 1080p resolution
* Makes editing a vertically oriented video easy

**Cons**

* The maximum duration of a video is limited to ten minutes
* Supports only the most common video file formats

**Conclusion**

Editing vertically oriented video doesn’t have to a long and slow process that takes days or weeks to complete. Each of the web-based vertical video editors we featured in this article has all the tools you need to create a vertical video quickly and effortlessly. Hopefully, this article has helped you find a vertical video editor that meets all your needs. Which web-based online vertical video editor are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.
