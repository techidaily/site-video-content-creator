## 10\. VirtualDub

VirtualDub is a processing utility and video capture licensed under the General Public license. It is designed in a way so that it can clean and trim the video before processing with another program or exporting to tape. It doesn't have the features close to Adobe premiere but is comparatively faster than all those software.

![virtualdub](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-dub-video-to-image-control.jpg)

This software can also process many files because of its batch-processing capabilities. Just like all other applications, it has its benefits, and you can use them to benefit yourself in many ways. It has a fractional frame rate, so you don't have to settle for 29 anymore. They also offer mouse and keyboard shortcuts for easy and fast operation.

 Pros

* Integrated volume meter
* Access to hidden video format
* Noise reduction

 Cons

* Slow process
* Poor interface
