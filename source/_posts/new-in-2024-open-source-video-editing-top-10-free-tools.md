However, because Shotcut was created for Linux, many users may find the UI a little strange. Regardless, it's still a fantastic editor.

## 10\. Avidemux

[Avidemux](http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/) is a **free video editor** for Windows, Mac, and Linux that doesn't aim to be a full-fledged timeline-based video editing software. Rather, it's made to make a few minor modifications and then splits out a new file.

You may import your source video and pick the start and finish frames to chop off segments. You may add filters to enhance the video by sharpening the picture or decreasing noise.

Some of the aesthetic options include color effects and borders, while others enhance the clip by sharpening the image or reducing noise. You may even add other clips to the end of your existing one, although this type of work would be better suited to a complete non-linear editor.

* Decent aesthetic options for video editing
* Edit multiple videos at the same time
