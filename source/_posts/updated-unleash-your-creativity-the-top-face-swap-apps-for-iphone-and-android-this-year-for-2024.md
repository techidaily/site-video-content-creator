Blender started out as an open-source project and over the years animators, scientists, VFX artists and numerous other people have participated in developing this 3D creation suite. The software can be used for modeling, animation, video editing or compositing, to mention only a few of its many purposes. Editing video footage isn't Blender's strong suit, but its video editing features are powerful enough to enable you to perform basic editing tasks. However, this doesn't mean you can't use this software to create videos that grab the viewer's attention.

**Features:** Cutting or trimming videos, adjusting the video's playback speed or adding keyframes to a video clip is an easy process in Blender. The software's true strength lies in its animation, 3D modeling or motion tracking features. The latest version of Blender is equipped with a motion tracking option that allows you to import the footage into the software directly from a camera. You can utilize this feature to mask areas of the shot and see the movement on camera in a 3D environment.

**Advantages:** Blender's price and its powerful features make it an interesting choice as your primary video editing software.

**Limitations:** You must have in-depth knowledge of animation, compositing, and 3D techniques in order to be able to use Blender.

In addition to the video editor, the PowerDirector app is also equipped with a powerful photo editor that lets you manipulate images in a professional manner. You can use almost any type of video or audio file in this app because it provides support for all commonly used file formats.

**Advantages:** PowerDirector is designed to help its users polish their video quickly and effortlessly.

**Limitations:** Videos in 1080p and 4K resolutions can only be exported after you've made an in-app purchase.
