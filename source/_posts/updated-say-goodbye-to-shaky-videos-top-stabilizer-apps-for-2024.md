## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

## Part 2: Best Video Stabilizer Apps for iPhone and Android

Here are the best video stabilizer apps for iPhone and Android for you to choose from.

Slow motion effects can add a "close-up in time", and introduce a feeling of surreality. If you want to slow down a video to show more details or transfer a kind of atmosphere to a video, you will need video editing software to do it. Here is a list of some of the best video editors to make a video slow down in the market.

## Top 10+ Slow Motion Video Editing Software

#### 1\. Wondershare Filmora

**Pricing:** Free trial

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Not just for slowing down or speeding up videos, the Filmora can also be used for a wide array of functions, such like slippting, cropping or reversing videos, and other advanced features like green screen, PIP, and face-off. The recent revamping of the user interface supports the easier use of more tools.

Filmora offers two ways to make a slow-motion effect in a video. The quickest way of applying the slow-motion effect to video is by selecting the target clip in the timeline, clicking the Speed icon in the toolbar, and choosing the target slow speed presets from **0.5X, 0.25X, 0.1X, 0.05X** and **0.01X.** The smaller the preset is, the slower the video will be.

![Filmora  change speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slow-motion-presets.jpg)

Of course, you can also right-click the video in the timeline, select the **Speed and Duration** option from the menu and then change the speed by dragging the speed slider or the duration period in the **Custom Speed** window.

![Filmora9 custom speed window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-speed-window.jpg)

Check the video below to see how to control the video speed and make a fast forward, slow motion or freeze frame video.

#### 3\. Twixtor

**Pricing:** Ranges from $82.49 for the upgrades to $595.00 for the full version

Continuously raising the bar for slow motion editing software, Twixtor is probably the most popular and highly praised video editing application that focuses on slow and fast motions in the market. Despite the commendations the software keeps getting, its pricing may be a little too expensive. The full version of Twixtor Pro falls at $595.00.

![timewarp](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/timewarp.jpg)

#### 4\. Slomovideo

**Pricing:** Free

Although its bare and unappealing graphical user interface might turn off some people, Slomovideo does what it was created to do, which is to slow motion in videos down, quite well. To add to that, Slomovideo is an open source program, which means that it is free. A downside, however, is that it seems slower than other software and applications. However, if you are opposed to shelling out hundreds of dollars in order to produce a crisp and smooth slow motion video with expensive software, then this freeware is for you.

![slowmovideo](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/slowmovideo.jpg)

#### 5\. MotionPerfect

**Pricing:** $49.95

This cross-platform utility allows the speed and frame rate to be set and the duration of the files to be changed. Motion compensated interpolation and morphing algorithms are used instead of repeating or blending contiguous frames.

![motionperfect](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/motionperfect.jpg)

#### 6\. Apple Motion

**Pricing:** Bundled with Apple Final Cut Studio

The feature Optical Flow within Apple Motion was once obscure but now many users attest to its quality. Being bundled with the Apple Final Cut Studio already, previous FCS users can use Apple Motion for free.

![apple-motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/apple-motion.jpg)

#### 7\. Boris Continuum Time Unit

**Pricing:** $199.00

Using the retiming effects of Optical Flow along with the automatic keyframe generation of the Beat Reactor, Boris Continuum Time Unit can produce high-quality slow and fast motion videos.

![boris-continuum-time-unit](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/boris-continuum-time-unit.jpg)

#### 8\. ReSpeedr

**Pricing:** $99

Similar to Slomovideo, Respeedr is also an open source video editing tool. It is a stand-alone application that makes use of a frame-based motion-flow analysis, which means that it uses dynamic frame-blending.It offers an array of time lapse and slow motion tools that are needed to make the transition smooth but the quality of the video crisp.

## Mastering Color Grading in Final Cut Pro

# Color Correction in Final Cut Pro

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

---

The steps below can help all beginners to develop easy video edited projects using Final Cut Pro, but if some of you find this platform a little difficult then it is good to start practicing as a beginner on [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a well-known video editor tool for Mac users that contains all powerful features and an interactive user interface to facilitate all beginners.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Methods to Correct Color in Final Cut Pro

Those who wish to use FCP for color signal editing need to follow these steps:

#### Step 1

First you need to open **Color Board** on FCP as there is an automatic color correction tool available inside. The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:

* You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing **CMD + 6**.

![Show Color Board”.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-1.png)

* On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.

![Effect Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png)

* Choose **Window** and then click on **Go To**, you will find **Color Board** on the appeared drop-down menu.

![Go to Color Board](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png)

* All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.

![Color correction effects on video inspector.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-4.png)

#### Step 2

As soon as you start working on **Color Board**, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.

![select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png)

As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the **Waveform** option.

![Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png)

#### Step 3

Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:

**Exposure or Brightness:** On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.

![Exposure or Brightness](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png)

**Saturation:** It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.

![Saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png)

**Hue:**  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.

![Hue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-9.png)

#### Step 4

It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.

![correction On and Off options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-10.png)

Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

## Methods to Correct Color in Final Cut Pro

Those who wish to use FCP for color signal editing need to follow these steps:

#### Step 1

First you need to open **Color Board** on FCP as there is an automatic color correction tool available inside. The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:

* You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing **CMD + 6**.

![Show Color Board”.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-1.png)

* On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.

![Effect Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png)

* Choose **Window** and then click on **Go To**, you will find **Color Board** on the appeared drop-down menu.

![Go to Color Board](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png)

* All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.

![Color correction effects on video inspector.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-4.png)

#### Step 2

As soon as you start working on **Color Board**, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.

![select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png)

As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the **Waveform** option.

![Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png)

#### Step 3

Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:

**Exposure or Brightness:** On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.

![Exposure or Brightness](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png)

**Saturation:** It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.

![Saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png)

**Hue:**  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.

![Hue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-9.png)

#### Step 4

It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.

The process is pretty quick, as the name suggests.

## **GoPro Quik Windows Features**

GoPro Quik app is rich with features, and it provides pretty much everything that you need to create amazing photos and videos. A few highlighting features are discussed below:

### 1.Create Amazing Videos In Just A Few Clicks

With GoPro Quik, making amazing videos is very easy. With just a few clicks, you can import all your videos and photos. Then you can edit them in just a few clicks. Everything here is so simple that you will feel like a pro video editor yourself.

### 2.Auto Cloud Uploads

Another amazing feature of GoPro Quik is that once you have done editing your videos, they will be automatically uploaded to your cloud. But for this feature to work, make sure that you have an active GoPro PLUS subscription.

### 3.Excellent editing

Simply click a few buttons to turn GoPro footage into an awesome video. Pick the perfect soundtrack, then pick your favorite moments. Your video automatically syncs with the music, so you can share it in just a few seconds. Make your videos come alive with panning effects by adding photos and time-lapse sequences.

### 4.Share with friends

Make short videos that are ideal for posting on Facebook, YouTube, and more. Make a unique video from your burst and timelapse photos. Additionally, you can find and save the most memorable moments in a video, then share them as high-quality still images.

### 5.New Speed Tool

Tap the pencil to choose the Speed icon for the video in your Media Mural. Then you can apply more than one-speed effect simultaneously. The speed can be toggled between real-time and half-speed slow motion. You can also add freeze frames for a specified period of time.

### 6.GoPro-Exclusive filters

From Media or Mural, select a photo or video and tap the pencil. In order to optimize the footage to the environment it was shot in, GoPro has created 25 filters in-house. By using the scrub bar, you can adjust the intensity of each filter.

### 7.Premium Themes

Alternatively, you may create a new highlight from Media. You will be presented with 13 video editing themes. Besides adding text and transitions, you can also change the music, choose the duration, and choose the right format for your intended sharing platform, such as social media or text.

##### Pros

Despite its ease and quickness, there are a few drawbacks to it. First, I must say this is awesome and perfect for anyone who has never edited a GoPro video before. When you're new to video editing software, it can be very easy to become frustrated and overwhelmed, so it's great for those who aren't familiar with it. It's all about getting that video off your memory card and putting it out there. That's it.

##### Cons

You cannot edit footage from your phone or DSLR with Quik App for Desktop - only GoPro footage can be used in Quik App. This is a GoPro app, after all. It should be used with GoPro content!

In addition to the ten free songs, GoPro Plus members have access to an additional song library. Users cannot import their own music either.

Additionally, you may only create a certain number of Highlights. Each 30-second video is limited to 10 Highlights.

## Final Verdict

Although GoPro Quik is amazing and comes with a lot of features, there are still many limitations of this application, as discussed in the cons section of this article. If you want to do basic editing, then this app will do just good, but if you are looking for advanced features like audio normalization, keyframing, color tuning, gif support, etc., then you will have to use another fully-fledged video editing app. We recommend you to give a try to our [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor.

Filmora comes with plenty of features and can easily compete with the most advanced video editors in the world. The best thing is, you can download and install it for free and try all of its features without paying a penny.
