After you sign in to your account on this platform, you should click on the New Project option that is located in the Projects tab.

![ Create Stop Motion with Captured Photos  - create project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-project-in-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

Once the Animation window loads, you will be able to see the timeline below the preview window that shows everything your web camera can see. After you composed your shot, you should simply click on the Camera button that is located on the right side of the screen, then move the object that is in the shot and click on the camera button again. You should repeat this process as many times as necessary until you have captured all the frames you want to include in your stop motion animation.

![ Capture Photos in  Cloud Stop Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-photos-with-cloud-stop-motion.jpg)

In case you want to alter the frame rate, you can click on the Project Settings icon that is located at the top of the toolbar in the upper left corner of the screen.

![ Cloud Stop Motion Project Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-project-settings.jpg)

Clicking on the Audio icon will grant you access to the Cloud Stop Motion’s [sound library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that contains hundreds of songs and audio effects. What’s more, you can also record voiceovers with this online stop motion maker, although you must first give the app permission to access your computer’s microphone.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Audio Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-audio-library.jpg)

Cloud Stop Motion is equipped with fully customizable title, credit, speech bubble, and chapter heading templates and you just have to click on them to add them to a project.

![    Cloud Stop Motion Titles Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloud-stop-motion-insert-titles.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Make Stop Motion Videos from Videos Online

In case you don’t have the photos you can use to create a stop motion animation, platforms like Kapwing allow you to turn a regular video into a stop motion video. All you need to do is upload a video clip from your computer or via a URL to Kapwing and the platform will automatically generate a stop motion video. One of the best part is that Kapwing also provides a sample if you don’t want to upload your own footage.

![    Import footage to Kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-stop-motion-footage-in-kapwing.jpg)

After the upload process is completed a new window will load where you can choose the speed at which frames are displayed on the screen and pick the rate at which frames are taken from the source video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker.jpg)

While adjusting these settings you should keep in mind that lowering a [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) too much can result in choppy footage and uneven movement of the objects in the stop motion video you’re creating.

Kapwing also offers the option to [play the video in reverse](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), but finding the right context to use this feature can prove to be a challenging task. Click on the Create button when ready to export the stop motion video and wait for the platform to generate the video.

![ kapwing stop motion maker export & share](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-stop-motion-maker-export.jpg)

Afterward, you can choose to download, edit or share the video on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. In case you created a stop motion video while you were logged out of your Kapwing account, the platform will add a watermark to it, and you must sign in to [remove](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it.

**Conclusion**

03 [Ways To Publish Videos On Linkedin](#Part 3)

04 [Importance Of Thumbnails In Linkedin Video](#Part 4)

05 [Tips To Create An Interesting And Effective Linkedin Video Thumbnail](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What is a LinkedIn video thumbnail and its size specifications?

A thumbnail for a video is like a preview image of the video and acts like its cover. The viewer will get an idea about what the video contains through its thumbnail image. Though the site chooses the first frame of the video as the thumbnail, you can even set a customized one that is attractive and interesting.

The **LinkedIn video thumbnail size** specifications are as follows:

**●** Image size: 1200 X 627 pixels

**●** Format of the image: JPG or PNG

**●** Maximum size of the image: 2MB

**●** Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratio of the thumbnail should match that of the video itself.

## Part 2 Publishing videos on LinkedIn

If you are planning to publish a video on LinkedIn, the first thing to know is the place where it will be published. LinkedIn allows adding the videos on the personal feed as well as on the Company pages.

If you are into an established business or a brand having a large number of followers, paid video posts on the company page work best.

For the small- setups and businesses who are looking to promote their products and brands posting a video on the personal feed is a good idea. Initially, you can start by posting on your feed and then can later create a company page.

## Part 3 Ways To Publish Videos On Linkedin

After you have decided that whether you will be posting a video on your company page or your personal feed, the next thing is to decide that how the video will be published. There are 3 different ways for posting a video as enlisted below.

**●** **Using YouTube and Vimeo links**

If you have your videos on Vimeo or YouTube you can paste their link on your LinkedIn account. To watch the video, a person needs to click on the link and it will then open in the hosting platform.

**●** **Using LinkedIn Native Video**

This is the most effective method where a video can be uploaded directly on your LinkedIn account from your system as well as your phone. While posting videos directly on LinkedIn, you can even add customized thumbnails, stickers, subtitles, and titles. A native video will play automatically as it is seen by the people in their feed and thus, they reach a larger number of people.

**●** **Using LinkedIn video ads**

To reach the target audience, a sponsored post is also an effective way and the video ads can be posted only through a company page. Depending on the type of product or the brand to be promoted, the video can be created.

## Part 4 Importance Of Thumbnails In Linkedin Video

The LinkedIn video thumbnail is one of the important factors that make your video engaging and interesting. Before a person starts watching your video, you need to ensure that they get interested in it and click it. For grabbing this first-time attention, a custom thumbnail works great. You can use any interesting graphic or an image related to your video and edit it to create a customized thumbnail.

A thumbnail can only be used when videos are posted as native LinkedIn videos.
