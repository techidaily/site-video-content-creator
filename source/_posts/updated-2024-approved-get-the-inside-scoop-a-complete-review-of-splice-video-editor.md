With easy-to-use features, a simple interface, and real-time previews for transitions between clips, unlimited layers, and audio mixing capabilities, OpenShot is one of the top free video editing software around. One of the best things about OpenShot is that its interface allows for easy-to-use drag and drop features. If you're a Mac user and looking for a free, open-source video editor that packs more features than iMovie—OpenShot is a great alternative you can't miss.

With OpenShot's special effects engine, users can modify, reverse, slow up or slow down videos, and preview projects in real-time. Furthermore, other standard features of OpenShot include composition, image overlays, clip resizing, trimming, snapping, scaling, watermarks, video transitions, title templates, creating personalized SVG vector titles, desktop integration, adjusting fonts, colors, 3D animated titles, and more.
