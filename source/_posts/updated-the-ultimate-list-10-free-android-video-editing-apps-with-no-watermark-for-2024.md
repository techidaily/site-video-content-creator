#### **Reverse:**

The word reverse as the name reflects, means that we can play a video from its end towards the initial position. Yes, it is possible to reverse the order of video frames in order to arrange them in such a way that last frame appears first following the reverse sequence so that first frame goes to the last position in the clip.

#### **Rewind:**

On the other side rewind is also an interesting feature for video editing where users simply duplicate the clip in form of a segment or make adjustments over range selection and then rewind that particular segment at a speed many times faster than the original speed of clip. After this they play segment of original clip in normal speed towards forward direction.

Although it is possible to get the rewind effect in videos with simple reverse option but still Apple platform supports both of these as standalone options.

## How to reverse a clip in Final Cut Pro

There are so many situations in our life when we wish to go back in past and change things for better scope; sadly, life does not provide that option in real. But there is an option to rewind or reverse things in the world of video editing as here one can easily make time fly backward and view things for fun. Before you start using the skills and tools for editing videos to create such a beautiful effect, it is good to go through few important terms.

#### **Difference between Rewind and Reverse:**

#### **Reverse:**

The word reverse as the name reflects, means that we can play a video from its end towards the initial position. Yes, it is possible to reverse the order of video frames in order to arrange them in such a way that last frame appears first following the reverse sequence so that first frame goes to the last position in the clip.

#### **Rewind:**

On the other side rewind is also an interesting feature for video editing where users simply duplicate the clip in form of a segment or make adjustments over range selection and then rewind that particular segment at a speed many times faster than the original speed of clip. After this they play segment of original clip in normal speed towards forward direction.

Although it is possible to get the rewind effect in videos with simple reverse option but still Apple platform supports both of these as standalone options.

## How to reverse a clip in Final Cut Pro

You might have heard about Retiming effect in videos where we either speed up our clip or slow it down by certain time factor so that a desired effect can be achieved. There are two types of retiming effects: Variable speed type and constant speed format. FCP is capable enough to merge the reverse option with retiming effects so that something innovative can be developed even with simple editing efforts.

#### **Step 1:**

First of all go to timeline and then select the desired clip from your collection that you want to reverse. It is also possible to apply this effect on a group of clips as per need.

#### **Step 2:**

Now you need to go to the pop up menu where an option for reverse the clip is available in form of an arrow pointing towards left direction.

**Compatibility:** Windows, MacOS, and Linux

Avidemux is a free, open-source video editing program with a clear interface, so enhancing video quality is easy with Avidemux.

The best thing about Avidemux when it comes to the top video quality enhancers is that it supports a lot of file formats. From FLV to MKV, AVI, WMV, MOV, OGM, MPEG, and MP4, Avidemux lets you enhance the quality of any file format easily. The multithreading option is also a great feature - and possibly the program's finest advantage.

However, there is no timeline, creative effects, or transitions to enhance the video.

#### **_5._**[**_Adobe Premiere Pro CC_**](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** Monthly license: $35.99

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

Over the last couple of decades, the Adobe brand has become synonymous with image editing. The company's software for editing still and moving images is considered among the best by most contemporary photographers, designers, and moviemakers.

Premiere Pro CC enables you to turn the raw footage captured by any camera in any format into awe-inspiring videos. Besides offering superb video editing options that include powerful color correction tools and amazing effects, the software also offers a decent amount of audio editing options.

The only downside is that Premiere Pro CC is not best suited for inexperienced video editors, and it takes quite some time to master all of its features.

#### **_6._**[**_Vegas Pro_**](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

**Price:**$399.00

**Compatibility:** Windows

Although Vegas Pro has never been as popular as Premier Pro, the video editing options, Vega Pro offers are no less powerful than those provided by Adobe's famed video enhancer. Vegas Pro software is equipped with tools that make the video editing process faster while maintaining a high quality of the processed footage.

The latest version of Vegas Pro also features Picture-in-Picture and Crop OFX plug-ins that let you overlay or experiment with several images in a single frame.

The Blue FX's Filter 5 Ultimate package contains 26 effects that enable you to use colors in your videos or change the light, so each video you produce with Vegas Pro can have the visual style you want.

#### **_7._**[**_Lightworks_**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:** free, monthly license $23.99

**Compatibility:** Windows, Linux, macOS

Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and Danny Boyle are just a few world-famous movie directors whose movies were edited in Lightworks. What's more, in 2017, the software won the Emmy Award for pioneering digital non-linear editing. Lightworks has been one of the industry's best video enhancers for nearly thirty years, offering groundbreaking features to cinema professionals adore.

This video editing software lets you do virtually anything if you know how to do it. Multicam editing, a rich selection of effects, or support for a wide array of video file formats make Lightworks an excellent choice for skilled video editing professionals.

Even though the free version of the software is available, buying a monthly or annual license is a much better option if you want to approach your next project professionally.

#### **_8._**[**_Final Cut Pro X_**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:** $249.99

**Compatibility:** macOS

The possibilities Final Cut Pro offers are nearly endless. The software supports almost all video file formats, its non-linear timeline lets you arrange all sorts of media files freely, and the color wheels allow you to enhance the colors in your videos by simply dragging the mouse cursor. Besides providing support for 360-degree videos, Final Cut Pro also offers 360-degree graphics and effects.

The video editor is built on a 64-bit, enabling users to work on highly demanding projects. However, it is best to check the system requirements before installing it on your Mac computer. Final Cut Pro is unsuitable for beginners in video editing because using most of its features requires an enviable amount of skill.

#### **_Conclusion_**

Now you know how to improve your video quality and which quality enhancer software suits you.
