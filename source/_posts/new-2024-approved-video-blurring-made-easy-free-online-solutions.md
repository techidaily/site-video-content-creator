# Color Correction in Final Cut Pro

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

The steps below can help all beginners to develop easy video edited projects using Final Cut Pro, but if some of you find this platform a little difficult then it is good to start practicing as a beginner on [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Methods to Correct Color in Final Cut Pro

Those who wish to use FCP for color signal editing need to follow these steps:

#### Step 1

First you need to open **Color Board** on FCP as there is an automatic color correction tool available inside. The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:

* You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing **CMD + 6**.

![Show Color Board”. ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-1.png)

* On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.

![Effect Browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png)

* Choose **Window** and then click on **Go To**, you will find **Color Board** on the appeared drop-down menu.

![Go to Color Board](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png)

* All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.

![ Color correction effects on video inspector.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-4.png)

#### Step 2

As soon as you start working on **Color Board**, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.

![ select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png)

As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the **Waveform** option.

![ Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png)

#### Step 3

Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:

**Exposure or Brightness:** On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.

![ Exposure or Brightness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png)

**Saturation:** It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.

![ Saturation ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png)

**Hue:**  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.

![Hue ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-9.png)

#### Step 4

It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.

![correction On and Off options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-10.png)

Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:

**Exposure or Brightness:** On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.

![ Exposure or Brightness ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png)

**Saturation:** It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.

![ Saturation ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png)

**Hue:**  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.

#### Step 4

It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.

Most of the advanced camera units these days are capable enough to produce shots with rich quality automatically but still some professionals need to edit captured videos for little color correction. The major reasons behind this additional color correction are:

* Some people need to correct their mistakes on captured videos; it can be due to an incorrect balance of white and due to under or over-exposure at some points.
* Customize different video clips by matching them so that they appear in sequence even if they are captured at different moments.
* For creating a specific style or look in order to support your mood; for example, one may need to make scenes appear cold, dark, cheery, warm, bright or foreboding.

No matter what you want to do for the customization of your videos, Final Cut Pro can provide your complete assistance. The details below can help you to collect complete information about color correction techniques.

Whether Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, Titanfall or Destiny is your favorite video game or you prefer more nostalgic style game play like Mario Kart 8 or NBA 2K15, chances are you want to record something fantastic that happens (or that you do!) within the game.

## Record Video Games with Fraps

[Fraps](http://www.fraps.com/) is the old standby that is easy to use, even for recording newbies, and remains the most popular choice for recording video gameplay. Aside from its simple user interface, it can display game benchmarks and easily make adjustments for framerates and sizing. Fraps was designed specifically to run while your games are playing and record in high quality, and it does a great job at that dedicated task. While some users complain that the size of Fraps files are huge, you can use a different application to compress the files for uploading and sharing.

## Use liteCam for game recording

The [liteCam game recording software](https://www.litecam.net/en/) can capture your game at up to 60 fps, and it will record OpenGL and DirectX games that other software cannot. While you simply choose from preset keys to set up your recording, which makes it easier to use, there is no option to capture still shots which some people like to have. Even though it does not have quite as many extra settings and tools as a lot of other video game recording software, it does produce good-quality recordings that many gamers appreciate for their use.
