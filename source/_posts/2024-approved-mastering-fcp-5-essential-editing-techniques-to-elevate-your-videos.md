It’s very common that you filmed some amazing portrait or landscape videos but in the wrong direction. This is an error made by many people because not everyone will always think about orientation when filming. Is there an easy way to flip/rotate videos so that you can watch them without turning your head sideways?

What you need is just an ease to use video editor like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to flip/rotate your video clips easily and quickly. This application offers a remarkably easy way to flip videos clockwise or anticlockwise, horizontal or vertical. What’s more, this flip software also offers a broad range of video editing features, effects and intro/credits.

In the following, I’ll describe how to flip a video in Windows using this video flip program. If you’re a Mac user, just adopt Wondershare Filmora X for Mac (Latest Filmora version X for Mac) to achieve the same.

First, please download Filmora X for free as per your operating system, and then follow the steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1. Import Your Original Video Clips

After launching Filmora X, click "New Project" to begin. Click "Import" to browse your file folder on computer or drag the video clips directly into the media library.

When you import all of them, click the thumbnails showing in the left pane to preview in the right screen window.

Note that this video editor supports an array of video & audio formats, such as MOV, MP4, AVI, WMV, DV, avchd (MTS, M2TS). And still image files like JPG, BMP, JPEG, PNG. TIFF are all fully compatible.

And then drag your video files from media library to the video Timeline.

[Learn the complete list of supported files formats of Filmora X.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 2. Flip the Whole Video

Then double click the video in the timeline to access the editing panel. In the window that appears, switch to Video tab and you will find Transform option located on the top.

Click on the Transform to expand the four options including Rotate, Flip, Scale and Position. To get the effect you need, you can adjust the Rotate and Flip settings and check the real-time effect in the previewing window. Though only four buttons available, you can create more options by using them together.

* **Rotate:** rotate video at any angle by entering the angle value or moving the Rotate slide: rotate 90° clockwise & anti-clockwise, rotate at 180°, rotate 270°, and more
* **Flip:** Flip video horizontally, i.e. flip video left to right; flip video vertically that is fliping video upside down
* You can combine Rotate and Flip feature to flip video vertically and rotate 90°clockwise or flip video vertically and rotate 90°counterclockwise.

Besides, you can also change the video position and the video scale. This is the step of flips the whole part of the video.

#### 3. Flip Only a Part of the Video

Sometimes, you may just need to flip parts of your video file, e.g. only 1 minute instead of the whole video. In this case, you need to [split your video into separate files](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and then repeat step 2 to flip them individually.

To do it, just move the playhead to the position you want to split, and click the "Scissors" icon in the menu bar.

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

**Supported Input:** MP3, M4A, WAV, AIFF, OGG, WMA, AIF

**Supported Output:** MP3, M4A, WAV, AIFF, OGG, WMA, AIF

The first of the **audio converters** on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an 'All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…
