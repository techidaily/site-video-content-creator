## 8 Best Free Online Video Stabilizers

Even though fixing shaky footage is possible, you shouldn't expect miracles because if your footage contains too many cameras shakes these online video stabilizers won't be able to produce perfectly stable footage in every shot. On the other hand, if your video clips contain only a moderate amount of shaky footage the following video stabilizers will help you create smooth videos.

Let's have a look at how you can stabilize your videos with these free online video stabilizers.

#### 1. EZGIF Online Video Stabilizer

You don't have to worry about the video's format, because the platform supports nearly all popular file formats like MP4, AVI, or MPEG. Here's how you can stabilize your video with EZGIF Online Video Stabilizer.

**Step 2:** To initiate the video stabilization process, you just have to click on the Stabilize button. The process will start automatically and its duration depends on the size of the file you're stabilizing.
