Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

02 [What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?](#Part 2)

03 [Video Resolution and Corresponding File Sizes?](#Part 3)

04 [Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?](#Part 4)

05 [Is HD 2K or 1K?](#Part 5)

06 [How to Change Video Resolution Easily?](#Part 6)

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

![File Size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-2.jpg)

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)

Ultra HD, often known as 4K resolution, is 3840 x 2160 pixels technically. It looks similar to 2K to the viewers but gives videomakers some room to zoom in or edit.

## Part 4 Are 480P, 720P, 960P Considered HD?

* 720p is also popular with the name HD (high-definition). It is a display resolution that measures 1280 x 720 pixels.
* 480p often known as Standard Definition (SD). It usually starts at 240 p and ends at 480 p. So, 480 p is a semi-HD.
* 960 X 480 p is a progressive camera scan format usually used in surveillance cameras, webcams, or action POV cams. It adds a wide horizontal view as compared to the standard definition. But it is less than HD.

## Part 5 Is HD 2K or 1K?

1K means there are 1000 pixels. So 1080p, as in the vertical portion of a screen, is 1K. In contrast, a typical 1080p resolution with the horizontal part is 1920, or 2K.

Although 1080p has the exact vertical resolution like DCI 2K resolutions (1080 pixels), it has a smaller horizontal resolution. As a result, it is below the range of 2K resolution formats.

1080p is almost equivalent to 2K. It is because "p" and "i" measure the height of an image in pixels, while "K" measures the width of an image in thousands of pixels.

So with a size of 1080 pixels, the corresponding width of 1920 pixels uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Video resolution is a way to determine how realistic or clear your video appears. You can measure it with the number of pixels in a standard aspect ratio (16:9).

16:9 is one of the most common aspect ratios for TV or computer screens. Also, a higher number of video aspect ratio pixels means high resolution.

The 720 or 1080 resolutions have naming conventions usually based on the pixels running in the vertical line of the display area. Whereas resolutions like 2K, 4K, or 8K have naming conventions based on pixels numbers in the horizontal lines across digital frames.

The growth of video sharing on social media has ensured the adoption of HD definition screens. So, let us know more about its concepts.

## Part 1 What is HD Video?

High-definition video (HDV) is a third-generation technology for videos. Its video resolution, file size, and screen size are more significant than a standard video or other video forms. It provides more flexibility, including technical variables of videos.

![HDV](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/hd-video-pixel-size-1.jpg)

Generally, it is a video with 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p) resolutions. It's all formats are widescreen and display 24 to 60 frames in a second.

## Part 2 What is the Pixel Size of HD Video?

HD Video is the lowest video resolution accepted for the web content of smaller size. However, most screens are available in HD nowadays. So, it would be best to use a resolution higher than 720 p for streaming or web.

Pixel Size of HD video is 1280 x 720.

## Part 3 Video resolution and corresponding file sizes

Video resolutions are the standards set by video manufacturers or broadcasting companies. Video resolution is similar to a haircut. You can always decrease a high-resolution video to a lower one but can never increase the low resolution.

So, decide the video resolutions keeping storage space and other aspects in mind. Here are different formats that can help you to make a wise decision:

### 1\. Standard Definition

Standard Definition does not have many pixels; as a result, it has low resolution. Two common SD resolutions are 640× 480 and 640×360\. These resolutions are the best for small mobiles.

It is an excellent option to consider if you have a slow internet connection.

### 2\. 720 Resolution (HD)

It is the lowest video resolution and is often called HD. Usually, you shoot most videos at 1080p, but 720p can still be acceptable to create smaller web content. However, it would be best to aim for a resolution higher than 720p.

### 3\. 1080 Resolution (Full HD)

1080 (1920 \* 1080 pixels), often known as Full HD, is the industry standard for making a digital video. It does not need much storage space and is a typical screen resolution for digital phones.

### 4\. 2K Resolution or QHD (Quad High Definition)

2K resolution (2048 x 1080 pixels)or QHD (2560 x 1440 pixels) formats provide room for photo edits. In addition, they offer larger displays or reframing files without their lost quality.

### 5\. 4K Resolution (Ultra HD)
