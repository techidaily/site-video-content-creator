Reducing a video’s size with Compressify requires a minimum amount of effort because you just have to upload a WebM video and the platform will do the rest for you.

Compressify reduces the size of your video files by 60% while maintaining excellent image quality. Even though the size of WebM videos you upload to this platform cannot exceed 8MB, the file compression process is incredibly slow.
