**Codecs** can either be lossless or lossy, depending on the method utilized to load or discard information that doesn’t change during a recording.

Moreover, [changing the file format](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video can also lower its size, but if you opt for this method you won’t be able to control how much your videos are going to be compressed.

Besides resolution reduction, you can also **lower a video’s bitrate and frame rate.** As you[reduce the number of frames](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that are displayed every second the size of a video file also shrinks. However, the quality of the video is going to drop as you reduce the number of frames that are displayed each second.

The lossy codec formats reduce the size of a video file considerably but they lower the video’s quality, which is why it is better to use lossless codecs if you are recording videos for YouTube and other social media platforms.

## Part 3: What are the Most Common Video Compression and File Size Reduction Methods Utilized by Video Compression Apps?

After the video recording process is completed there a number of methods you can use to **reduce the size of the file** you created. The fastest and the easiest way to compress a video is to **[change its resolution.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** So, if you shot a video in 4K resolution changing its resolution to Full HD will reduce its size.

Most video compressor apps offer **preset output video resolutions** and allow you to change the resolution value manually. Moreover, [changing the file format](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of a video can also lower its size, but if you opt for this method you won’t be able to control how much your videos are going to be compressed.

Besides resolution reduction, you can also **lower a video’s bitrate and frame rate.** As you[reduce the number of frames](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that are displayed every second the size of a video file also shrinks. However, the quality of the video is going to drop as you reduce the number of frames that are displayed each second.

Probably the best way to keep your video files under a certain size limit is to **[shorten their duration](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).** Trimming or cutting out all the parts of a video clip can help you shrink its size, which makes it easier to upload to YouTube or any other social media platform that supports video content.

## **Conclusion**

Compressing video files on Windows 10 is a simple process regardless of the video compressor app you choose. However, the number of the video compression tool you’ll have at your disposal can impact the quality of the output video. That’s why you have to pick a free video compressor for Windows 10 that caters to all your needs. Which of the five free video compressors for Windows 10 we covered in this article are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.

![toolbar stt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg)

If you're looking, specifically, for a clean method of doing so, then it's understandable if you're facing difficulty with finding the right one. There are many **speech-to-text** audio converters available.

However, not all of them are all that great in quality. In this article, we'll be introducing a couple of converters that you can use to change **audio to text** as well as show you how to do it

#### In this article

01 [Is There an App That Converts Voice Recording to Text?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert Audio to Text - FREE & No Time Limits](#Part 2)

03 [Best 6 Free Paid and Online Speech-to-text Software in 2022](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is There an App That Converts Voice Recording to Text?

Do apps that convert **speech to text** actually exist? The quick answer? Yes

Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.

And, just to be very clear, there are many more **speech-to-text** apps like this one

![Transcribe - Speech to Text App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%201.png)

## Part 2 How to Convert Audio to Text - FREE & No Time Limits

For this next part, we’ll be introducing a variety of different methods that you can use to convert **audio to text**. From apps, software, online solutions, etc. There are plenty of ways, so you can find the one that works best for you

### 01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO

The first and most common way to turn **speech-to-text**—especially for those who want something more accessible no matter what device they are on—is online **speech-to-text MP3** converters A great example of one of these online tools is the MP3 to text converter, VEED-IO. The key feature here is that you won’t have to download or install anything to start using it Also, VEED.IO (and many other online **speech-to-text** converters) is FREE.

![Online MP3 to Text Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%202.png)

### 02Windows Dictate

This next one is more of a live **audio-to-text** tool. Or rather, a live transcriber tool, but it can be useful despite the fact, especially since, once again, it is 100% free and FREE to use. What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users. It’s there to increase accessibility for those with vision impairment, but it’s also a great way of easily converting your **speech to text**.

![Windows - Speech | Dictate Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%203.png)

### 03Smart Phone App - Transcribe

As mentioned earlier, there are apps out there that work in pretty much the same way. Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced **speech-to-text** functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe. It also has support for over 150+ languages and has a convenient notes function for taking advantage of the transcription function.

![Voice-to-Text App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%204.png)

### 04Google Docs

Another 100% FREE method of getting live **speech** **to text** is Google Doc’s “Voice Typing” function. You can turn this on at any time by making use of the command ‘Ctrl+Shift+S’ or by turning it on manually from the ‘Tools’ tab on a Google Document (shown in the image below). It’s a very easy way of getting your thoughts onto paper while working on other things.

![Voice Typing Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%205.png)

### 05Apple Dictation (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)

If you’re a Mac user, then the second item on this list was probably of not much use to you. But, don’t worry, Windows Dictates has a Mac/iOS counterpart It’s in the form of Apple Dictation Again, it was set up to increase accessibility for users with visual impairment, but it can be pretty useful as well for the times when your hands are too busy to actively type your thoughts down.

You can turn on this feature by going to your device’s ‘Accessibility’ settings and enabling ‘Voice Control’ (as is shown in the image below). It will need to be downloaded and installed onto your device, but it should begin working pretty quickly after that.

![apple Voice Control Features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%206.png)

## Part 3 Best 6 Free, Paid, and Online Speech-to-text Software in 2022

For this next section, we’ll be introducing some other **speech-to-text** solutions. Specific ones this time though A URL for each tool will be provided, as well as a description of how each one works. It will be a mixed list, so expect both FREE & Paid solutions.

### 01Otter.ai

Otter.ai is an **audio-to-text** solution that is advertised as an automated notes-taking tool The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that is available for most devices (Mac, PC, tablets, smartphones, etc.) There is a FREE version of the software available as well. So, if you’d like to try it out before committing to it, that’s definitely possible

![ai Note-Taking Solution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%207.png)

### 02Watson Speech to Text

Watson **Speech-to-Text** is a FREEmium cloud-based **audio-to-text** converter that, much like Otter.ai, you can try for free It offers multi-language support. And is perfect for transcribing live audio for a more professional setting.

![Watson Speech to Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%208.png)

### 03Dragon Anywhere

When people talk about advanced transcription methods, the first one to come is usually “Dragon Anywhere.” Again, much like Watson, this is a business solution that is often found in more professional settings. Also, it comes in a software version (for desktops and laptops) and an app version (for tablets and smart devices). The price of this particular piece of software is high, but there’s no denying that it produces high-quality **speech-to-text**

![Dragon Anywhere Professional Dictation App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%209.png)

### 04Verbit - Transcription & Captioning

Our next pick, ‘Verbit’ is popular with content creators as it is marketed as both a transcription and captioning software (for adding subtitles or captions to video content). It is a FREEmium software as well as a more of a business solution. But that only means that you have access to more advanced features.

![Verbit Captioning and Transcription Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-to-convert-speech-to-text%2010.png)
