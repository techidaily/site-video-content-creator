The best part is that the software can be used on iPhones and iPads, as well as on Apple's computers, so you can edit your footage immediately after you capture it.

iMovie supports 4K videos, making the editing process fun and easy. You have to arrange your clips on the timeline, select the background music, create opening titles and end credits or add some cool visual effects and you're ready to share your videos with the public. iMovie lets you share your 4k videos to YouTube, Facebook, or Vimeo directly from the Export menu, so you don't have to waste time waiting for your videos to be rendered and uploaded to your social media account.
