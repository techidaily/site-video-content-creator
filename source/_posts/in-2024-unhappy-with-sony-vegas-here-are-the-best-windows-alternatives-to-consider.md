## Vegas alternative for Windows

#### 1\. Adobe Premiere Elements - A Program like Sony Vegas

When a product is branded with Adobe, it means high quality, better performance, and consistency with another program by Adobe. [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html) is a **good Vegas alternative for Windows** (Mac version also available). Just as what's said on its homepage "the #1 consumer video editing software", Adobe is a popular video editor for home users.

For professionals, Adobe Premiere Pro is the better Sony Vegas alternative for Windows. It's the higher version of Premiere Element with differences in capturing, timeline editing, multiple sequence editing, DVD menu, surround sound mixing, etc.

#### 2\. ZS4 Video Editor - Free Alternative to Sony Vegas in Windows

[ZS4 Video Editor](http://www.zs4.net/news) is a free Sony Vegas alternative for Windows, Mac and Linux. It is the new incarnation of the free Zwei-Stein Video Editor. It comes with simple video editing tools and 150 video effects, but the interface is not so user-friendly. Compared to Wondershare [Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Adobe Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html), ZS4 Video Editor is not the common video editing software, but free is the most important factor for this Sony Vegas alternative.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

VirtualDub is a free and powerful video capture and processing software for Windows platform. Other than being able to accomplish the basic video editing tasks such as compress, trim, remove audio, you can also apply special effects like adding subtitles and more. However, if you have transferred to the Mac platform, you may need a VirtualDub alternative for Mac because VirtualDub only supports Windows OS natively.

## Best VirtualDub for Mac Alternative - Filmora for Mac

As regard of the best VirtualDub for Mac alternative, Wondershare [Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an ideal choice. This software enables you to edit almost any video, audio or photo file, using all common video editing tools. Besides, you can also easily retouch your video with effects like jump cut, tilt-shift and much more. Now let’s take a close look at the main features of this easy-to-use yet powerful mac video editor.

Let's check the video tutorial first!

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

This VirtualDub for Mac alternative supports virtually all video formats including MP4, FLV, AVI, MKV, VOB, 3GP, ASF, MOV, F4V, M4V, MPG, TS and more. That means you don't have to deal with any ‘pre-conversion’ worries- just drop whatever you have to get started!

### Intuitive and user-friendly interface

Filmora for Mac also provides a nice organized workspace that allows for video, text and audio layering. The drag-n-drop feature enables you to easily access everything, so you don't need to upload your media files from the containing folders. The preview window is also included in the main interface so that you’re able to see the real-time effect without opening a player for it.

![VirtualDub Video Editor mac](https://images.wondershare.com/guide/images/mac-vivideo/mac-vivideo-add-files.jpg)

## VirtualDub for Mac Alternative - iMovie
