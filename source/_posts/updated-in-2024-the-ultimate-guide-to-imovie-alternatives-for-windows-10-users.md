It has been some time since Microsoft stopped all support for Windows 7, which left PC users without the[iMovie equivalent Windows Movie Maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.

However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for [video editing software for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.

That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.

## Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 \[Free & Paid\]

iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.

### 1\. [Windows 10 Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.

You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.

Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.

![Editing videos in iMovie Alternative Photos App on Windows10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows10-automatic-created-video-with-photos-app.jpg)

### 2\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are looking for a video editing app for Windows 10 that enables you to edit the videos recorded with action cameras, Smartphones, or DSLRs, then Filmora is probably one of your best options.

Wondershare’s video editor provides support for 4K videos, and it is compatible with almost all commonly used video file formats. Starting a new project or importing the footage into Filmora is a straightforward process that requires a minimum amount of effort. Creating the opening titles, enhancing the colors in video clips, applying filters and image overlays are just a few among the countless video editing options Filmora provides.

What’s more, the video editor is equipped with a music library that contains a selection of royalty-free songs, which enables you to create a soundtrack even if you don’t have the music you can use in your videos. You can export all your projects to your accounts on Vimeo or YouTube directly from Filmora, but you should keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of this video editor are going to be watermarked.

### 3\. [Adobe Rush](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html)

Most of the applications that are included in Adobe’s Creative Suite are designed to meet the demands of professional users. However, the Adobe Rush app that is compatible with desktops and Smartphones is easy to use, and it enables you to edit even while you are on the go.

Adobe Rush enables you to capture and edit your footage from one place, and it stores all your projects on the cloud so that you can open them with Adobe Premiere Pro if you want to perform advanced video editing tasks.

The app offers instructions at every step of the video editing process, which means that you don’t need any previous video editing experience to create a new video with Adobe Rush. Moreover, sharing the videos you edit with this app on Instagram, Facebook or other social media platforms won’t take much more than a few moments of your time.

You can use Shotcut to detach audio from video, set keyframes, or cut and trim each clip you add to the editor’s timeline. This video editing software features a rich library of transitions, which enables you to avoid hard cuts in your videos.

Moreover, Shotcut has all the tools you’re going to need in order to fine-tune the colors in each clip you want to include in the final cut of your video. The software’s audio editing capabilities are equally impressive, you can easily fade in and fade out audio files, control their volume or apply filters to them. The best part is that Shotcut doesn’t have demanding system requirements, so you can use it on computers that don’t have a lot of processing power or powerful graphics cards.

### 5\. [CyberLink PowerDirector 365](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/overview%5Fen%5FUS.html?r=1)

## Aspects You Need to Consider while Choosing the iMovie Replacement for Windows 10

Determining which video editing app for Windows 10 you should choose is going to be much easier if you already know which types of videos you want to create. Moreover, the editor you choose has to offer support for the file format or the resolution in which the video was captured. Here are some of the most important factors you need to consider before installing a new video editor on your computer.

### 1\. 4K Video Editing Support

Recording videos in 4K resolution has become more popular in recent years, as Smartphones and action cameras started offering this option. So if you are recording 4K videos often, you need video editing software that enables you to edit the videos recorded in this resolution. Moreover, you need to make sure that the video editing app you’re interested in allows you to export projects in 4K resolution.

### 2\. Cross-device Capability

Social media content creators often want to share their videos just moments after recording it. So, if you are often creating videos you share on social media, you should choose a video editor that is also compatible with iPhones and Android devices. Having the option to edit videos from both your Smartphone and your computer will make it much easier to share fresh content on social media.

### 3\. Built-in Features & Resource

The number of video editing tools, the sizes of audio and video effects libraries, or how many transitions a video editing software offers are all the factors you need to consider before you opt for one option or the other. On the other hand, getting a video editing app for Windows 10 that offers advanced video editing tools is only a good option if you are planning to learn how to use these tools.

## Conclusion

Even though Windows 10 no longer has an iMovie equivalent, it is still relatively easy to find a video editing app for Windows 10 you can use to edit your footage quickly before sharing it with your friends on social media.

You don’t need to have a ton of video editing experience in order to create videos with video editors like Filmora or Adobe Rush. Which iMovie replacement are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.

## Aspects You Need to Consider while Choosing the iMovie Replacement for Windows 10

Determining which video editing app for Windows 10 you should choose is going to be much easier if you already know which types of videos you want to create. Moreover, the editor you choose has to offer support for the file format or the resolution in which the video was captured. Here are some of the most important factors you need to consider before installing a new video editor on your computer.

### 1\. 4K Video Editing Support

Recording videos in 4K resolution has become more popular in recent years, as Smartphones and action cameras started offering this option. So if you are recording 4K videos often, you need video editing software that enables you to edit the videos recorded in this resolution. Moreover, you need to make sure that the video editing app you’re interested in allows you to export projects in 4K resolution.

### 2\. Cross-device Capability

Social media content creators often want to share their videos just moments after recording it. So, if you are often creating videos you share on social media, you should choose a video editor that is also compatible with iPhones and Android devices. Having the option to edit videos from both your Smartphone and your computer will make it much easier to share fresh content on social media.

### 3\. Built-in Features & Resource

The number of video editing tools, the sizes of audio and video effects libraries, or how many transitions a video editing software offers are all the factors you need to consider before you opt for one option or the other. On the other hand, getting a video editing app for Windows 10 that offers advanced video editing tools is only a good option if you are planning to learn how to use these tools.

## Conclusion

Even though Windows 10 no longer has an iMovie equivalent, it is still relatively easy to find a video editing app for Windows 10 you can use to edit your footage quickly before sharing it with your friends on social media.

You don’t need to have a ton of video editing experience in order to create videos with video editors like Filmora or Adobe Rush. Which iMovie replacement are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.

#### 17\. [CyberLink PowerDirector](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)

**Price:**Free trial, Paid version: $69,99 - $129,99

**Level:** Semi-pros

![cyberlink powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector.jpg)

This is probably one of the best and most popular video editing software packages aimed at amateur and semi-professional users. There are several versions of the software available, and each of them contains a different amount of options and video editing tools. Even with somewhat reduced capability, the least expensive version of the editor supports 360-degree as well as VR options for posting on social media such as Vimeo, Facebook or YouTube. CyberLink PowerDirector isn't a professional video editing software, but it still offers a lot of extraordinary options that can take you a step closer to producing a professional video.

**Features:** The 360-degree video editing options are probably the first thing that catches the eye when you look at the list of features the software provides, but its true power lies in its color tools. LUTs, HDR effects or Split Toning options are just the tip of the iceberg since PowerDirector offers countless tools for fine-tuning of the colors in your videos. Animated PIP effects and video collages make this video editing software a perfect choice for the production of tutorials and all other types of online videos.

**Advantages:** The audio editing options provided by CyberLink PowerDirector are nothing short of amazing since they enable the software's users to manipulate the audio files in any way they see fit.

**Limitations:** Motion tracking and color lookup features are not always reliable. The software is a bit overpriced when compared with similar video editing suits.

Magix has been the largest European video editing software manufacturer for more than two decades.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinemaster-green-screen.jpg)

This cross-platform video editor is one of the premier options for mobile video editing on both iOS and Android devices. KineMaster is currently the only app that enables Android Smartphone owners to add as many layers of videos, photos, and text to their projects as they want. However, it only supports a limited number of video file formats, which means that the app shouldn't be used to edit videos that weren't recorded on an iPhone or Android phone. KineMaster provides a wide range of video exporting options and allows you to share videos on popular social media networks.

**Pros:** Above average video and audio editing features.

**Limitations:** Offers a lot of options mobile video editors seldom use.

Creating neatly organized projects with LumaFusion is a simple task because the app features a powerful Project Manager that lets you sort files or select aspect ratios for your videos. In addition, the Media Library lets you import all types of files from a cloud storage or drag and drop media from other apps. Producing slow-motion videos that have 120 or 240fps or creating green screen videos using the Chroma Key effect is easy with LumaFusion. The app's audio editing features are as impressive as its video editing tools since they provide the complete control over the audio files to the video editor's users.

**Advantages:** Color correction options, LUTs or numerous visual effects are all part of the reason why LumaFusion is one of the best apps for mobile video editing.

**Limitations:** Only available for iOS devices.

#### 33\. [Vizzywig 2019 4K Video Editor](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vizzywig-2017-4k-video-editor/id913424818?mt=8)

This award-winning app for iOS devices provides all the tools a skilled video editor could desire. Its features include support for 4K videos, wide selection of aspect ratios as well as stylish intros, end credits, and titles. Besides offering professional video editing tools, Vizzywig also features Multi-Camera recording options that can capture videos in 8K resolution. In addition, the app is capable of producing videos that have eight times more pixels than the Apple's Facetime HD Camera. The non-linear timeline lets you arrange video clips in any way you see fit, and allows you to add multiple media files to each project you are working on.

**Advantages:** Lets you control the focus and exposure manually and produce videos with stunning picture quality.

**Limitations:** Single platform compatibility and a high price narrow down the number of the app's potential users.

#### 34\. [PowerDirector](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyberlink.powerdirector.DRA140225%5F01)

**Platform:** Android

**Price:** Freemium, contains ads and in-app purchases

**Level:** Beginners

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-android.jpg)

Unlike the Adobe's app for mobile video editing, PowerDirector lives up to all expectations. This user-friendly app lets you create reverse, 4K, or green screen videos. To make things even better, you can easily apply visual and audio effects or add voiceovers to your projects. In addition to the video editor, the PowerDirector app is also equipped with a powerful photo editor that lets you manipulate images in a professional manner. You can use almost any type of video or audio file in this app because it provides support for all commonly used file formats.

**Advantages:** PowerDirector is designed to help its users polish their video quickly and effortlessly.

**Limitations:** Videos in 1080p and 4K resolutions can only be exported after you've made an in-app purchase.

Ooops…It looks like there isn't any tool that matches your demand. Please give it another try.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.

## Part 1: What is Video Stabilization?

Video stabilization refers to algorithms that remove undesirable camera tremors and jitters caused by hand jiggling and the unintended camera panning to improve video quality.

Without affecting moving objects or purposeful camera panning, video stabilization technology is used to minimize visual quality loss by decreasing undesired shaking and twitches of an image/video capture equipment. This is especially important in portable imaging equipment, which is more susceptible to vibrations due to its smaller size.

Excessive hand wobbling and purposeful camera panning often result in inconsistent photos, while undesired camera position variations result in unstable image sequences. Video stabilization techniques maintain good visual clarity and steady video footage even under less-than-ideal settings.

It is not always feasible to re-enact a video, and in those cases, we must make amends with what we have. This approach will necessitate particular video stabilization software, which will increase the movie's transparency, allowing more innovation and modification.
