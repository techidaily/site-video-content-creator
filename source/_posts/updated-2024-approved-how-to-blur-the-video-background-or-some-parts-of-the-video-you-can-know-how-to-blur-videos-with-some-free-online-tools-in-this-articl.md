To add transitions, you can click **Transitions** at the top, and then drag your favorite transition effect to the track over the video to apply.

To make your videos more stunning, you can also switch to the “Intro/Credit” tab to add different intro/ credit effect to timeline. To change the effect and text, choose the “Title” function and customize it as you like.
