The days of silent cinema are long gone, and today sound is an inseparable part of a video, no matter how long or short it may be. The videos you discover on the Internet sometimes have great soundtracks, but they are not saved in file formats that are suitable for playback in [audio media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Converting a WebM video to MP3 is probably one of the easiest ways to turn videos you find online into audio files you can listen to whenever you want. In this article, we are going to take a look at the top ten WebM to MP3 converters you can either install on your PC or Mac computer or use online.
