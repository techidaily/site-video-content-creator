 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It's an age-old battle, [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) or [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer's own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the 'this is the one I like' argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output. For anyone looking for more than just an editor, it is the choice to make. Find some instructional material, dive in, and have fun.

[Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools. For the more experienced this is probably not a factor, but it is worth considering for newcomers.

#### 3. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Workflow comparison

Once that initial barrier is overcome, however, I feel that the added functionality, workflow efficiency, and compatibility-out-of-the-box Premiere can deal with roughly double the number of [media formats](https://helpx.adobe.com/fi/premiere-pro/using/supported-file-formats.html) \- of Adobe's product makes it a superior product for long-term use.

The key here is long term, no one wants to relearn everything every couple of years, switching platforms endlessly searching for the ultimate product, so when making a choice for video editing I would always suggest that prospective users consider not just what they want now, but what they may want in the future. Vegas has the easier entry path, there is absolutely no question, however what if you later want the more sophisticated editing facilities? If you switch then you still have to go through learning Premiere, after learning Vegas. Learning one piece of software is a better choice, so which one will fulfill future needs should be taken into account.

#### 4. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Compatibility Comparison

There is also the issue of other production requirements. If you are aiming towards motion effects, animation, and other composite effects within your work, then consider the platform that will be carried out on as well. Here is where Adobe's strength shines. The various products they put out work together extremely well, and [in the case of video effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Premiere and After Effects together offer a workflow and output quality that is as good as it gets. Saying either will do the job is not really a satisfactory conclusion for these types of comparisons, even if it is actually true. However, there are answers here.

## Part 2: FAQ about Vegas

### 1\. Can Sony Vegas be used on a Mac?

Sony Vegas professional was not generally a SONY item, and it is not, at this point, a SONY item.

It was offered to Magix before this previous year. It was initially a DAW [Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) programming that had video highlights. After some time, it developed into the item a considerable lot of us know and love, Vegas Pro.

A hearty and expert video altering programming! SONY hoped to port Vegas over to Mac for quite a while. They had effectively discharged a Mac form of SoundForge, and Vegas would have been straightaway.

I surmise they ran into a huge amount of specialized issues, the greatest being that they just needed Mac programming abilities.

Apple additionally discharged FCPX as a $299 altering application for Mac, which removed any gainfulness from the condition for SONY. So that answers why Sony Vegas on Mac is impossible.

### 2\. Is there a Sony Vegas for free?

No, you do not get a Sony Vegas on Mac completely free at any time. However, there is a way in which you can torrent it or go for a free trial version.

Despite the option, the better suggestion for you is to go and purchase it instead of downloading it from anywhere else. It is because choosing the second option may lead to leakage of data from your computer.

Otherwise, you can also use alternative software such as Hitfilm Express or Lightworks. So, now you know that the Sony Vegas ‘Pro’ is just a faux term because there is no difference between the professional and normal version.

Both come at a premium cost anyway.

### 3\. How much does Sony Vegas cost?

There are [different plans of the Sony Vegas](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as Vegas Pro Edit, Vegas Pro, Vegas Pro 365, Vegas Pro Suite. The Vegas Pro Edit generally costs around $698\. Next, The Vegas Pro comes at the cost of $898\. The popular Vegas Pro 365 is priced at $16.67 for every 3 months.

So, you need to pay a total of $66.68 annually. Lastly, the Sony Vegas Pro Suite comes at $1098 and is the costliest of all the versions.

In conclusion, Premiere is the more capable program, both in terms of workflow, output, and its ability to integrate with other applications to produce much more advanced output.

It's an age-old battle, [Vegas](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/) or [Premiere](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), a comparison that many have made over the last few years in the market, as always when making a comparison, things are always skewed by the writer's own views, so it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions. Here we aim to lay out the specifications of each product and discuss their effects on workflow, output, and usability to form an opinion beyond the 'this is the one I like' argument. However, we are aware of making a completely fair comparison is impossible. We will try our best. Hope you will enjoy it!

Again the [Premiere spec-sheet suggests it is a close call](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html), and to be brutally honest that is mostly the truth. Premiere does have more ability within the editing department there is no question. There are very few things that Vegas does better (3D manipulation being the standout), but distilled into the bare bones of a list of 'things', so the differences are not so obvious. The usability factor for Vegas carries on into the editing process too, although it is perhaps inevitable that Premiere's more complex abilities lead to a more complex interface structure and a steeper learning curve, it is still a truth that Vegas is just easier to get results from at the start.

Underneath the [Vegas specifications](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/specifications/) though, Premiere does have plenty going for it, the Mercury Playback Engine that drives the editing suite enables renders real-time playback that saves time and makes for a much smoother workflow for any project, and whilst it will not apply to everyone, the multiple camera abilities are second to none and for those that use them, an invaluable and significant tool for producing professional-grade output.

I keep returning to this point, but in a comparison of the two products it is a very important one, whilst ultimately Premiere has more ability within it for producing high-quality video, it is the learning curve that is [the major difference for new users](https://www.udemy.com/). This should be a consideration for anyone looking at the two, however, the complexity of Premiere is not an insurmountable issue. There are numerous tutorials, both free and commercial, available to get any level of the user through the first steps of understanding the processes within Premiere, and of course the same is true of Vegas, although to my mind they would not be as essentially an item, whereas with Premiere, the very least that is required is going through Adobe's own online video education for the software.

#### 2. Sony Vegas VS Adobe Premiere: Specification Comparison

As we can see at first glance the two seem very comparable regarding the basic tools and utilities. The one glaring difference does not mentioned in the basic specs outlined above, however, is that Sony Vegas is a Windows-only product. [Premiere has versions for both Mac and Windows](https://www.premierebro.com/blog/adobe-announces-windows-and-mac-os-support-changes-for-future-releases), and whilst the dominance of Apple within the creative industries is nowhere near what it once was, a sizable number of people still use the Mac platform, and for them, Vegas isn't even an option without resorting to emulation, which is a processor-intensive operation like video editing is not really a viable solution.

It is also important to consider that the spec-sheet itself doesn't tell the whole story, with the audio and [effect modules more advanced in Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/effects-animation-presets-overview.html), however, Vegas has the benefit of being a much easier program to get to grips with for anyone new to the video editing world, and although its abilities are perhaps ultimately not as sophisticated as Premiere, new users often find they get better results with Vegas due to the accessibility of its tools.

Adobe Premiere Pro offers different paths to importing and exporting videos. Here we mainly discuss how to import and export media files in Adobe Premiere Pro.

This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out.

## Importing

There are two main ways to import media into Premiere, the import command and the media browser. They do things slightly differently and have uses they are both best suited to, here we will look at the process itself and which method to use in a given situation.

#### 1\.  Import Command

This is a straightforward command that works like most other programs, and is accessed from the file menu, or via the Control+I shortcut on the PC or Command+I on the Mac. You can also double click an empty area of the project panel to automatically open the import dialogue.

Whichever way you access it, you get the standard for the platform import dialogue box we see here.

![Import videos to Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-1.jpg)

This method of importing is best suited to self-contained media such as audio or graphics, or video files such as MP4 that are single files themselves, whose location on your computer you know so you can navigate to them easily. This is not the way to import videos from cameras, as they invariably create complex file and folder arrangements that make choosing the correct files difficult. This is where you would opt for the media browser method instead.

#### 2\.  Media Browser

Whilst on the surface media browser appears to do the same job as the import command the way they carry out the task is somewhat different, media browser is designed to let you see the media created by cameras, and show you easy to understand icons and metadata rather than the intricate pattern of files and folders they use. This makes picking the correct clip from a selection much easier, with metadata showing you date and duration as well as file type.

![Import videos to Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-2.jpg)

The media browser panel is found in the project panel, which on the standard layout is the bottom left corner, and can also be accessed by the Shift+8 shortcut. As you can see from the screenshot it works like an operating system file browser and allows you to navigate through the file directories of hard drives and removable media connected to the system.

One of the benefits of media browser is to narrow down the type of media being shown, so you can set to avchd for instance and it will display just that type of file in a given location. Because many projects use media from different sources this can be a real boon to finding the right file within a list.

#### File Types

Media browser displays more or less any file there is in a given location, and importing is simply a matter of selecting the correct file and double clicking it or right clicking and selecting import from the menu. You can select multiple files at once by holding down shift and import them all together if needed.

There are some exceptions to this, however, despite having a huge number of file types supported natively within Premiere, you will sometimes run into files that are not supported, FLV and MKV files being the most common ones, but this is not the end of the world and there is a simple solution.

[Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) offers an easy way to convert any file you may have into media that Premiere can use quickly and efficiently, and is a great tool to have alongside premiere if you commonly work with multiple file types.

## Exporting

The ultimate aim of any project is obviously to finish it and let others see the result of your creativity, and that means exporting your work into a format that is suitable for the medium you wish the project to be viewed on. Premiere offers a number of options regarding export, you can select an entire sequence to export as a single file for the web or disc, choose a single frame to post to a website, blog or to distribute through email, you can export just the audio, or just the video from a sequence, and if you have the right hardware, can export directly to tape or disk.

To export a project that closely matches the original media in quality and frame rates, often called a master copy, is very straightforward in Premiere, with the sequence selected, either in the Timeline Panel or the Project Panel, you simply use the File > Export > Media path :

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-3.jpg)

Which opens the media export dialogue.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-4.jpg)

Selecting 'Match Sequence Settings' here creates a finished file that matches the quality of the original source media. Then you simply choose a suitable name for the file in the Output Name field, and click export. This creates in essence a digital clone of the sequence, and best practice is to always do this for any project, however, for many projects, this is not necessarily the format you would want the final product to be in, those concentrating on YouTube output, or someone wanting to author a DVD for instance will need other options.

Thankfully Premiere caters here as well. Instead of selecting the 'Match Sequence Settings' within export dialogue, you can click on the 'Format' field to change the type of file that is produced. What options here can vary depending on codecs installed, this screenshot shows only those that are included with the product for clarity.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-5.jpg)

Depending on which format you choose. The preset below will allow you to choose a wide range of output settings to suit the intended platform. For instance, selecting  format brings up a huge number of presets for various Tablets and Phones, but also for Vimeo and YouTube, which is why it is one of the most common output formats. Here's a look at some of the presets available from the menu.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-6.jpg)

Once you choose a preset, you can further modify the parameters to suit the project you are working on and even save those as an additional custom preset for later projects should you wish. Again, choosing a suitable file name and clicking Export ends the process.

The other common requirement is for DVD or Blu-Ray files. Whilst you need access to the appropriate hardware to burn the disk, Premiere creates the file structure for that natively and you have two options here. Mpeg2 in either DVD or Blu-Ray form, or  Blu-Ray. With high quality source material, the two formats are virtually indistinguishable in their final format, however, MPEG2 will be much quicker to render and is a good choice for most applications. Although  does allow more content to fit into a given space, so it does have uses. Importing and exporting are the foundation of Premiere use, and as we have shown Premiere makes it very easy to do and produces the right file types for whatever your project is to be used for.

With the addition of [Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) you have a workflow that can ingest and export any type of media file you will ever come across with the minimum of fuss.

![Export videos in Adobe Premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-export-6.jpg)

Once you choose a preset, you can further modify the parameters to suit the project you are working on and even save those as an additional custom preset for later projects should you wish. Again, choosing a suitable file name and clicking Export ends the process.

The other common requirement is for DVD or Blu-Ray files. Whilst you need access to the appropriate hardware to burn the disk, Premiere creates the file structure for that natively and you have two options here. Mpeg2 in either DVD or Blu-Ray form, or  Blu-Ray. With high quality source material, the two formats are virtually indistinguishable in their final format, however, MPEG2 will be much quicker to render and is a good choice for most applications. Although  does allow more content to fit into a given space, so it does have uses. Importing and exporting are the foundation of Premiere use, and as we have shown Premiere makes it very easy to do and produces the right file types for whatever your project is to be used for.

With the addition of [Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/) you have a workflow that can ingest and export any type of media file you will ever come across with the minimum of fuss.
