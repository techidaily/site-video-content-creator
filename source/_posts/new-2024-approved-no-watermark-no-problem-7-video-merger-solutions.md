In this case, we will be discussing 6 video mergers without watermark, and the way we can use them – the tools and features they offer, and how we can get the best out of them.

* **Photos by Microsoft**

If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.

### How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?

* **Fastreel by Movavi**

[Fastreel](https://www.fastreel.com/) is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop/add multiple files right away.

## Top Hidden Gems: Free Speech-to-Text Apps for Mac Without Downloads

Do you struggle to meet deadlines for your text assignments? If you do, then you are in luck. Speech recognition technology is the best way to beat this challenge. Whether you are a student or a corporate professional, several speech-to-text apps can be used to guarantee that you meet your deadlines. For example, Mac owners can use dragon for Mac to complete typing assignments in half the time.

Below are the best speech-to-text apps on Mac you might have missed since the beginning of 2022\. Some of the apps in the list are in-built into your device, while others may require you to download additional software. Regardless, all of those listed below are free to use on your Mac device. Keep reading to find out more.

## Part1: Top 1 Built-in Mac Dictation Feature

![top 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-1.jpg)

Did you know your Mac device comes with a built-in speech-to-text feature? So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device's microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.

The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.

Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.

Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:

1. Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select **System Preferences** from the resulting menu.
2. Click on the **Keyboard** option from the system preferences screen.
3. Once there, click on the **Dictation** option located at the top of the menu.
4. Select **On** to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the **Use Enhanced Dictation** box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.
5. Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.

Please note that you need to speak your punctuation loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.

## Part2: Top 2 Microsoft Word \[Free & No Download\]

![top 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-2.jpg)

Another option to consider is speech-to-text Microsoft Word Mac. The app is free to use and relies on Microsoft Azure Speech Services to transcribe text. Below are the requirements to use speech-to-text word mac.

* An external microphone for your Mac desktop, or you can use your built-in microphone for your MacBook. This is because speech-to-text on Microsoft word mac only allows input with a microphone rather than an audio file upload.
* An active Office 365 subscription. Please note you need to log in to your account for the app to function.
* Insider builds 16.32 (19120802) and above.
* An active internet connection.

Once you have everything set up, follow these steps to use speech-to-text on Word.

1. Launch Microsoft Word from your desktop.
2. Click on the **Dictate** button from the top menu of your Word document, and wait for the red dot to appear. The button features a microphone for easy identification.
3. Once the dot appears, start speaking to transcribe your text. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for the best results. In addition, speak louder when transcribing punctuations.
4. Click on the Dictate button to finish the transcription.

## Part3: Top 3 Google docs

![top 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragon-for-mac-3.jpg)

Google Docs is arguably the market's most accurate free speech-to-text service. In addition, it allows you to transcribe your voice to text and format documents with your voice. However, you can only use the service through the Chrome browser.

Follow these steps to activate Google Docs voice typing on your Mac device:

1. Launch the **Chrome** browser on your macOS and select **Docs** from the app menu. Please note you will need an active Google account to use the service.
