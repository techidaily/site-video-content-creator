 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The amount of video content uploaded to the Internet each day is staggering, as people around the globe create hundreds of hours of videos daily. As a result, the videos you upload to social media must stand out in this sea of content to get thousands of views, shares, or likes.

**[Speeding up or slowing down the footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is a simple and yet effective video editing technique that can make the content you share online more entertaining to watch. Read on if you would like to find out more about **slow and fast motion video apps for iOS and Android** devices you can use to process your footage before posting it on your social media accounts.

## 10 Best Video Speed Changing Apps for iOS and Android

Sharing the raw footage, you capture on a Smartphone with your friends and followers may not always produce the results you’re hoping for. Slowing down the playback speed can make a scene more entertaining or highlight an important moment in your video. Increasing a video’s playback speed is a great option if you want to create breathtaking time-lapses. So, let’s take a look at the **10 best video speed-changing apps for slow and fast motion video editing on iOS and Android devices.**

### 1\. Filmora for mobile

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Supported OS:** [iOS](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) 11.0 or later, [Android](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) 4.2 and up

Changing the playback speed of the footage you edit with Filmora takes just a few moments since this cross-platform app enables all of its users to choose how rapidly the frames in each shot will be displayed on the screen.

This app provides a versatile set of video editing tools, enabling you to **enhance the colors in your videos**, make a soundtrack or even **[create a PIP effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. The only downside is that the free version of the app watermarks all videos you export from it, and you must make an in-app purchase in order to remove the watermark from your videos.

**Pros**

* Simple video playback speed adjustment process
* A rich library of visual effects
* Supports all common video file formats

As its name suggests, this video editing app provides YouTubers and Vloggers with all the tools they need to create the content they share with their followers. As soon as you record a new video clip with your iPhone or Android phone, you can import it into the app and remove all parts you don’t want to include in the final cut.

Altering the speed of a video clip is easy since you have to decide if you want to speed up or slow down a video and then insert a new playback speed value.
