## Unleash Your Creativity: Top Vertical Video Editing Apps for Mobile

# Best Vertical Video Apps for iOS and Android

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The cameras on iPhones and Android phones enable us to capture high-resolution footage with a single tap, but the videos we record with our Smartphones are not always perfect. **Vertical video editing apps** provide a simple solution to these issues, as they allow their users to edit their footage just moments after they recorded it.

The ease of use, the number of available video editing options, or the ease of use are some of the aspects we considered while choosing the vertical video app we included in this article. So, let’s take a look at what the best vertical video apps for iOS and Android devices have to offer.

---

## The Best Vertical Video Apps for iOS and Android Devices

Being able to post content to your social media pages from wherever you go can help you attract a large number of followers. However, in order to do that, you will need a reliable [video editing application](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that has all the tools you need to polish a video and adjust its aspect ratio to the demands of the social media network to which you want to post it. Here are some of the **best vertical video apps** you can find on Google Play or App Store.

Note: The vertical editing apps are listed in no particular order.

### 1. [Quik](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![ Quik Vertical Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quik.JPG)

Content creators that often shoot their videos at outdoor locations with [GoPro cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are going to love using the Quik app because it enables them [to edit their footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) while they are on the go. You can combine up to 75 videos and photos, and Quik will analyze them automatically and apply corrections wherever it is needed.

The app also grants you access to more than twenty themes that contain transitions and graphics, so that you can just upload the footage you want to include in a project and Quik will do the rest for you. Each of these themes is fully customizable and you can easily trim a video clip, [alter its playback speed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or set a preferred aspect ratio.

**What We Love About Quik:**

* The automated video editing process
* Voice detection feature
* The music library contains more than a hundred royalty-free songs
* Compatible with nearly all GoPro cameras

### 2. [Vue](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vue-video-editor-slideshow/id1458609369)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![ Vue Vertical Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vue-video-camera-and-editor.jpg)

Vue is equipped with both [video recording and video editing features](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) so that you can capture and edit your videos from a single app. You can capture videos in 1080p resolution without any duration restrictions, and it also lets you apply filters to your footage while the recording session is still in progress.

The app’s video editing options are as impressive as its video recording capabilities, since cutting, trimming or merging videos and photos requires a minimum amount of effort.

There are more than fifty video filters available in the app’s effects library while [adding a text overlay to a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) requires only a few taps. You can export all your projects to TikTok, Instagram, Wechat, and other social networks directly from Vue.

**What we love**

![ Spark Camera  Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spark-camera-video-editor.jpg)

Even the free version of the Spark Camera app offers all tools you are going to need to record a stunning vertical video. All you need to do is hold your iPhone or iPad in a vertical position and hold the Record button to start capturing a scene you want to share with your followers on social media. Moreover, the app lets you choose if you want to [shoot your videos in 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or Full HD resolution.

Installing iMovie on your iPhone or iPad is probably one of the easiest solutions you have at your disposal if you want to create vertical videos. You just have to import a video into a project you created in iMovie and add it to the timeline in order to start editing it.

Afterward, you must make sure that the video clip is selected and then tap on the crop button.

If you already recorded a vertical video, you can just import into a project you created in iMovie, and edit it, but you should keep in mind that the app is going to [add black bars](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to the video.

**What We Like About iMovie**

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## But why would someone want to convert a video to a GIF, to begin with? There are several explanations for this

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.
