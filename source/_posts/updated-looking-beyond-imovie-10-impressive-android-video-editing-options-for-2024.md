While most videos nowadays are rectangular, and are recorded in either landscape or portrait orientation, there are some social media platforms that require the clips to be square shaped. If you want to upload your footages on such websites, it is essential to learn **how to change video shape**.

Another benefit of changing the shape of the recorded films is that they can be adjusted in limited amount of space, especially if they are to be posted on a website. Furthermore, some fancy designs such as star-shaped or circle-shaped videos attract more attention when used in digital marketing campaigns.

With that said, here you will learn **how to change the shape of a video** using one of the most advanced and versatile post-production tools, Wondershare Filmora.

Want to learn more about aspect ratio of your video? [Click here!](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Or, you just want to [transfer your video into vertical.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: How to Change Video Shape from Rectangle to Square

Depending on the recording device and the target audiences a video is intended to be distributed to, the aspect ratio of the produced footage could be 16:9, 4:3, or 21:9 that makes the film rectangular-shaped. Given that, the aspect ratio can be modified to change the film shape from rectangle to square.

The instructions given below explain **how to change video shape** from rectangle to square in Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Video to Timeline**

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC (a Windows 10 computer is used here), click the **Add Files** icon from the center of the **Media** window present at the upper-left section, and use the **Open** box that appears to select and import the source video to Filmora. Next, drag the video from the **Media** window to the Timeline, and select your preferred option when/if the **Project Setting** confirmation box appears.

**Step 2: Change Aspect Ratio**

Select the video in the Timeline, and click the **Crop and Zoom** icon from the upper-left area of the Timeline itself. On the **Crop and Zoom** window that opens next, select **1:1** from the **Ratio** drop-down list, and click **OK** to save the new setting.

**Step 3: Export the Video**

Click **EXPORT** from the top-center area of the interface, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** box, select your preferred format from the **Format** list in the left pane, optionally click **SETTINGS** from the right window to make other adjustments if necessary, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner of the box.

## Part 2: Change Video Shape by Cropping

If your preferred aspect ratio isn’t available in the ‘Ratio’ drop-down list of the ‘Crop and Zoom’ window, Wondershare Filmora allows you to manually change the video to a custom shape.

That said, following are the instructions to apply both types of masking to your videos:

For details, check [how to edit videos with the Microsoft Photos app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

## Part 2: How to Add 3D Effects to Video with Filmora

Although Photos is a free app in Windows 11, it has certain limitations. This is where [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a product by Wondershare, comes into play. Wondershare Filmora is a post-production application for both Windows and Mac computers, and is considered a good competitor of some of the industry-standard video editing applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, DaVinci Resolve, etc.

While the Photos app can add 3D effects to the videos quickly, Filmora gives more control by offering a plethora of editing tools, options, and presets. In addition, Filmora is a timeline-oriented tool that allows you to add effects, filters, and/or elements in their corresponding layers without making any changes to the original footage.

You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline**

After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the **+** icon from the bottom-right corner.

When the confirmation box appears, either click **Match to Media** or **Keep Project Settings** to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.

**Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions**

Click **Titles** from the toolbox at the top, type **3D Titles** in the **Search titles** field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click **3D titles** from the suggestions list.

![find 3d title effects filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg)

From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.

![add 3d title effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, double-click the placeholder text in the **Preview** window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click **OK** from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.

![edit 3d title effects in video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg)

To add the transitions, click **Media** from the toolbox at the top, click **Import Media** from the **Media** box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to **Transitions** from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.

![add 3d transition effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, move the **Playhead** (**Skimmer**) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the **Spacebar** on your keyboard to preview the video.

**Note:** It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.

**Step 3: Add Elements and Effects**

Go to **Elements** from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.

![add 3d elements to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg)

To add effects, go to **Effects** from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the **Effects** layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.

**Note:** The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.

![add 3d effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

**Conclusion**

If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.

**Step 4: Export the Video**

Click the **Play** button from the bottom to preview the video with the 3D effect, and if everything looks fine, click **Save a copy** from the bottom-right area.

![save video copy with 3d effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-video-copy-with-3d-effects.jpg)

When the **Finish your video** box appears, choose your preferred resolution from the **Video quality** drop-down list, and click **Export**.

![export video with 3d effects windows photos app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-video-with-3d-effects-windows-photos-app.jpg)

Next, choose your preferred destination folder in the **Save As** box that opens up next, specify the name of the output file in the **File name** field, and click **Export** to export the modified clip in MP4 format.

**Note:** Videos that you export from the Photos app are by default saved in MP4 format.

As one of the [best basic video editing software for beginners](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the Microsoft Photos app allows you trim video, add text to video and much more. For details, check [how to edit videos with the Microsoft Photos app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on Windows 10 and Windows 11.

## Part 2: How to Add 3D Effects to Video with Filmora

Although Photos is a free app in Windows 11, it has certain limitations. This is where [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a product by Wondershare, comes into play. Wondershare Filmora is a post-production application for both Windows and Mac computers, and is considered a good competitor of some of the industry-standard video editing applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, DaVinci Resolve, etc.

While the Photos app can add 3D effects to the videos quickly, Filmora gives more control by offering a plethora of editing tools, options, and presets. In addition, Filmora is a timeline-oriented tool that allows you to add effects, filters, and/or elements in their corresponding layers without making any changes to the original footage.

For macOS 10.12 or later

You can follow the step-by-step instructions that are given below to learn how to add 3D effects to a video with Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Source Video and Add It to the Timeline**

After installing Wondershare Filmora on Windows 10 or Windows 11, launch the program, click anywhere inside the Media box present at the upper-left section of the interface, and locate and import the source video to the program. Next, hover the mouse over the thumbnail of the video, click the **+** icon from the bottom-right corner.

When the confirmation box appears, either click **Match to Media** or **Keep Project Settings** to adjust the project settings according to the media clip or modify the media clip according to the project preferences while adding the footage to the Timeline respectively.

**Step 2: Add 3D Titles and Transitions**

Click **Titles** from the toolbox at the top, type **3D Titles** in the **Search titles** field present at the upper section of the upper-left box, and click **3D titles** from the suggestions list.

![find 3d title effects filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-3d-title-effects-filmora.jpg)

From all the available 3D title presets that appear next, drag the one you like to the Timeline, and place it above the video track.

![add 3d title effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-title-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, double-click the placeholder text in the **Preview** window, and replace it with your caption. You can customize the font, color, and alignment of the text from the options that appear on left. Click **OK** from the lower-left area of the left pane to exit the editing mode. Repeat the process for all the texts that the preset has. Optionally, drag the sides of the 3D title in the Timeline to specify its duration of visibility on the screen.

![edit 3d title effects in video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-3d-title-effects-in-video-filmora.jpg)

To add the transitions, click **Media** from the toolbox at the top, click **Import Media** from the **Media** box, and repeat the process explained earlier to add a new video clip to the Timeline. Make sure that both the clips are on the same track, and are placed next to each other. Now, go to **Transitions** from the toolbox, and drag and place your preferred transition effect between the two media clips in the Timeline. Optionally you can drag the sides of the transition inwards or outwards to increase or decrease the speed of the effect respectively.

![add 3d transition effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-transition-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

After this, move the **Playhead** (**Skimmer**) to the beginning of the Timeline, and press the **Spacebar** on your keyboard to preview the video.

**Note:** It is a good practice to preview your video several times during the entire editing process. This will help you identify the error sooner, and you will be able to address the issue with fewer hassles.

**Step 3: Add Elements and Effects**

Go to **Elements** from the toolbox, drag your preferred element from the upper-left box to the Timeline, and place it on a new track. You can drag the sides of the element in the Timeline to increase or decrease its visibility during video playback.

![add 3d elements to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-elements-to-video-filmora.jpg)

To add effects, go to **Effects** from the toolbox, drag your preferred effect from the upper-left box, and place it on a new layer in the Timeline. As it is with other entities, you can drag the sides of the effect to increase or decrease the duration of its impact on the video. Next, double-click the **Effects** layer in the Timeline, and use the available options in the box to make further adjustments.

**Note:** The options that you get by double-clicking the effect in the Timeline may vary according to the adjustments it allows you to make.

![add 3d effects to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-3d-effects-to-video-filmora.jpg)

Once this is done, preview the video, click **Export** from the top-center, and use the tabs and options on the **Export** box to export the modified video in your preferred format.

**Conclusion**

If you are new to the VFX and video editing industry, trying hands with the Photos app would give you a fair idea about how things work. Once you are well-versed or if you are already a post-production professional, you can and you must go for a dedicated program like Wondershare Filmora that not only has an intuitive interface, it is also equipped with a plethora of presets to add 3D titles, elements, transitions, and effects to the videos without much hassle.
