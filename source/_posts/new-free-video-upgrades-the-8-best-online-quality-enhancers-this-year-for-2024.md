## Part 2: FAQs About Kapwing Online Video Editor

**1\. Is Kapwing really free?**

Yes, it is free, and there will be no watermark on videos under 5 minutes. However, upon exporting, the videos remain available for the public which could be a breach of privacy for some users. This limitation can be removed by subscribing to the web tool’s paid membership. You can choose either a $192 per year or $24 per month plan for the subscription.

**2\. What is the limitation of using the Kapwing free plan?**

When you use Kapwing with the free plan:

* All the videos that you produce remain available for the public viewing;
* The video files that you upload cannot exceed 250MB in size;
* Export 3 hours of video per month, and each video is limited to 30 minutes long;
* The resolution of the videos is restricted to 720p only, etc.

**3\. How slow can I make it with Kapwing?**

You can slow down the playback speed to 0.25x with Kapwing. When increasing the speed, it can go up to 4x.

**Conclusion**

Kapwing is an efficient online video editor. The best part is, the tool doesn’t add a watermark to the videos even if you are using its free plan. However, certain restrictions like file size limit, resolution threshold, etc. are imposed on you if you are a non-paid user. To get rid of all such barriers, you must subscribe to a monthly or annual plan that is $24 or $192 respectively.
