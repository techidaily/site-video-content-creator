## Part 1: How to convert 4k Videos to MP4 format or any formats

To convert the 4k video footage to mp4 formats or any other formats, such as AVI, MOV, 1080p/720p/480p MP4, and WMV, you should begin by downloading the [Wondershare Video UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

#### Step 1. Import files

You should import the video files which you wish to convert to the Converter tool. There you have an option of directly using drag and drop into the application or by going to the ‘File’ button in the menu bar and choosing ‘Load Media Files’.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/convert-phone-video-6.jpg)

#### Step 2. Setting the desired format

**Conversion of videos to the 4K MP4 format:**

By clicking on the ‘Format’ button which is found at the bottom of the panel, it will open the dialogue box of the format window. In the ‘format’ icon, you will find the ‘video’ option. There select the format of ‘4K Video MP4’.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/images/4k/3.jpg)

**Conversion of 4K or Ultra HD videos into other audio and video formats.**

Start by clicking the ‘format’ button found below on the screen. In the ‘format’ option select ‘video’ or ‘audio’ categories, this is where you will find various audio and video formats. Select the one which you require.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/convert-video-6.jpg)

For converting 4K or Ultra HD format video into MOV, WMV, HD MP4, MKV, WMV etc. in 720p or 108p, follow this method. Go to the ‘format’ icon and select the ‘HD’ option. Click on the ‘settings’ option on the bottom right side to open the settings popup, here you can select video resolutions from 1920\*1080 or 1280\*720.

#### Step 3. Conversion of videos

Click on to the ‘Convert’ icon to start the process of converting videos from 4K MP4 videos to other formats or vice versa.

This is how you can convert your video files.

## Part 2: How to Download 4K Videos to MP4

#### Step 1.Installing the 4K Video Downloader

The foremost step is downloading the software and getting it installed. After installation, launch this program and browse through it to get a hang of it. Its user-friendly interface will make your work a lot easier.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/get-started-4.jpg)

#### Step 2. Search for the 4K videos you wish to download

4K videos are supported in the browsers of Chrome, Firefox, and IE. In any of these browsers go to the media streaming websites. Search for the type of 4K videos you like. Select one and play that video.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/download-5.jpg)

#### Step 3. Download 4K videos

In the browser when your video is loading, you will find a floating Download button. It will emerge at the above right corner of the video frame. Now one can download the video directly by clicking on to that download button. Then the program will start to analyze. You can also find video-related information like download speed, size, and name of the video during download.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/download-6.jpg)

Another way to download the 4K videos is by copying video’s URL and pasting it into the URL space given at the above left of the program’s screen. Then the downloading process starts. You should opt for dragging the URL into the program if the file size is huge. Because waiting for the video to load becomes arduous.

Once the process of downloading is complete, double-click on the video from the Download category to play. If the size of the 4K video is huge, try converting it into different formats. So you can easily import it into your other portable devices. You can do this by clicking on the ‘convert’ button which is displayed on the right side.

If you want to edit the downloaded and converted MP4 video footage, we recommend you to try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is also supporting 4k video footage editing. Or you can check some [free video editing software for mp4 video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

##### Ways to Totally Help Your Find Best Flac Converter

An easy yet powerful editor

Numerous effects to choose from

Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

![Select Download MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%205.png)

We have eight recommendations for you below that will allow you to pretty much do whatever you want (i.e., **convert FLAC to MP3**, convert **FLAC to ALAC**, **convert WAV to FLAC**, MP4 to FLAC, FLAC to MP4, M4A to FLAC, WAV to FLAC, and so much more.)

We've even included a handy general tutorial just after this to make sure that you're able to easily make use of your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)](#Part 1)

02 [8 Best Free FLAC to MP3 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **How to Convert FLAC to MP3 (Fast & Brilliant Way)**

As promised, we'll be starting this off with a general tutorial that you can refer to when using the converters that we've listed below! The tool that we will be using for this step-by-step breakdown is an online **FLAC Converter** called FreeConvert. We did not include it on our list just to make sure that you have the most options possible, but it definitely deserves a spot of its own, since it is a **free FLAC converter** as well.

### 01**Step 1: Open FLAC Converter!**

To start things off, you need to either launch (if it's software) or open (a.i., open the website for an online converter) your chosen **FLAC Converter**.

Once you've got your **FLAC Converter** all revved up. The first true step is the 'UPLOAD' step. This is when you use the upload features provided to prepare the FLAC audio that you want to convert.

For the tool we use for our example, you can do it in one of two ways:

**●** Upload Manually: Either from your device, from Dropbox, from Google Drive, or through a URL link.

**●** Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and then drop the FLAC audio for conversion.

Here's a link to FreeConvert in case you wanted to try it out for yourself:

![Upload FLAC Audio File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%201.png)

### 02**Step 2: Confirm Output Format!**

For our example, we'll be converting from **FLAC to MP3**. And so, when prompted to choose the desired output format, we choose "MP3"!

(Most converters will have multiple audio file formats and video file formats that you can convert to if you want to do something completely different — as is shown below):

![Confirm MP3 as Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%202.png)

### 03**Step 3: (Optional) Advanced Settings**

Before finishing up, you might want to explore the extra advanced settings offered by your chosen **FLAC Converter**! Each one will have different features.

FreeConvert, as an example, will allow you to adjust volume, add fade-in, add fade-out, reverse audio, and, even, trim audio before conversion! All you have to do to access these functions is to click the "SETTINGS" icon (pointed out in the image).

![Advance Settings Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%203.png)

### 04**Step 4: Convert FLAC to MP3**

To initiate the actual conversion with FreeConvert, all you really need to do is click the 'Convert to MP3' button. Other **FLAC converter**s, while not the same, should be similar.

![Select Convert to MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%204.png)

### 05**Step 5: Download Converted FLAC Audio!**

Finally, when the conversion has been completed, select the 'Download MP3' button to save your converted audio to your PC! That's it, you're done!

![Select Download MP3 Button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ways-to-totally-help-your-find-best-flac-converter%205.png)
