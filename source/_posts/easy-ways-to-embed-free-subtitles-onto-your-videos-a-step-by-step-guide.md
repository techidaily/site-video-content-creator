## FAQs about BIGO Screen Recording

### 1\. Why can't I screen record Bigo Live?

Most of the time, this is because your device does not have enough capacity or you did not grant permission to the tool you used to record. Check the storage space on your device (phone or computer) to solve this problem. Check to see if you have allowed the screen recorder to record a video. If everything appears to be in order, but you still cannot begin recording, try restarting your device.

### 2\. Is it illegal to screen record protected videos?

It all depends. Screen capturing protected videos for personal use typically falls into a legal gray area. But if you distribute or use such recordings for commercial purposes, then it is prohibited and breaches copyright rules.

### 3\. Does BIGO allow screen recording?

No, it doesn't offer a screen recording function, but you can record the BIGO screen with third-party tools. However, remember that don't use the recorded content for any commercial purposes.
