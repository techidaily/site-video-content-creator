The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

We’ve picked out some of the best **audio converters** available right now based on several different factors

You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.

#### In this article

01 [How to Convert Audio?](#Part 1)

02 [How we tested the best audio converter software?](#Part 2)

03 [Essential Features of Audio Converter Software](#Part 3)

04 [What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

****Step 4: Start Conversion!**

Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting 'CONVERT’.

![Start conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%204.png)

****Step 5: Download or Save File!**

Once the conversion has been completed, your **audio converter** will either give you an option to 'DOWNLOAD’ or 'SAVE’ the finished product to your device!

![Download or Save Converted Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%205.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

## Part 1 **How to Convert Audio?**

Before we start listing the best **audio converters** down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an **audio converter**! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the **audio converters** on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!

****Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!**

The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The **free audio converter** that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual 'launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!

![Launch Audio Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%201.png)

****Step 2: Upload Audio File!**

The next general step is to 'Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the 'UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.

![Upload Audio for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%202.png)

****Step 3: Select Output Format!**

The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.

![Select Audio File Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/the-6-best-audio-converter-software-to-pick%203.png)

## Part 2 **How we tested the best audio converter software?**

In order to make sure that we are providing the ultimate list of **audio converters** out there, we’ve tested every single one on this list (and then some!) We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!

## Part 3 **Essential Features of Audio Converter Software**

There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best **audio converter** software for them:

**●** **Input Formats and Output Formats**: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.

**●** **Conversion Speed**: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.

**●** **Bonus Features**: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!

## Part 4 **What's the Best Free Audio Converter Software Programs**

Now to get to our list of the best **free audio converter** software available! We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best **audio converter** for each type of user…

 Apart from the video editing features, Filmora facilitates you to edit the audio sources too. You will be able to trim and split the audio clips separately. Adjusting volume with fade in and fade out features and voice overs will benefit you in creating an exceptional audio clip to match the video you created.

 You can load the videos you captured to your pc and then directly import them to the work area or the Filmora and start editing. If not, you can directly record videos into the Filmora and do your editing by; Clicking the Record button on the upper left corner of the Media library panel and then, in the pop up Capture Video window, clicking the record to start recording and clicking it again to stop recording. After the recoding is done, click OK to save the recorded video file in the default Captured file folder.

 Fully featured edition of the Filmora is available from $29.99 per year. However, you can download the demo version and try. The demo version contains Filmora Logo on all the output videos.

 **Pros**

* Easy to use interface
* Highly affordable
* Hundreds of inbuilt effects
* Record or import options
* Compatible with Windows and Mac

 **Cons**

* Watermark appears on Demo mode videos

#### 2. [Final Cut Pro X](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12)

 This is another powerful tool which is compatible ONLY with Apple. There are various effects available to use. Filters, transitions, videos enhancements tools, color adjustments and interesting text designs are available with Final Cut Pro X. This is a good software tool for a professional video editor. Need some time to get familiar with the interface as the interface is little bit complex because of the features. Fully featured version is available for a rate of $299, which is hardly affordable for a beginner level video editor.

 **Pros**

* Large number of tools with interesting effects
* Can produce professional video edits
* Lots of templates are available

 **Cons**

* Price is too high for a beginner
* Compatible only with Apple machines

#### 3.[Vegas Pro](http://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

There are innovative editing tools like Edit SD, HD, 2K, and 4K material in 2D or stereoscopic 3D, with drag-and-drop functionality. Also it supports traditional 3-point and 4-point editing modes. However, concerning the price factor, SONY Vegas is hardly recommendable for someone as it costs $599.95 to purchase the full version

 **Pros**

* Innovative features
* Lots of filters
* Support any format

 **Cons**

* Very high price ($599.95)
* Needs High End PC perfomances
