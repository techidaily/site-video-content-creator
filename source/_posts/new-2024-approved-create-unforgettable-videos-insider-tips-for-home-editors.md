 Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as well as [online video hosting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and social media platforms.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.

Optionally, you can adjust the frame rate, choose a video codec or select a new resolution for the video you’re converting. What’s more, the Video2Edit platform lets you disable a video’s audio track or change the audio codec.

 Creating a profile on this file conversion platform will enable you to convert WebM video files that are smaller than 400MB. Purchasing the premium version of Video2Edit will enable you to convert WebM files that don’t exceed a 1GB size limit.

### 9\. [Onlineconvertforfree](https://onlineconvertfree.com/convert-format/webm-to-mp4/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $6.99

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with Onlineconvertforfree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/onlineconvertfree-webm-to-mp4.jpg)

 You don’t need any previous experience with the file conversion process to convert a WebM video to MP4 with the online file conversion platform. Simply upload a file from your computer or from an online source, choose MP4 as the output file format and then download your file after the conversion.

 The platform offers batch conversion options, which can be quite useful if you are looking to convert multiple video files quickly. It is worth noting that converting a video larger than 500MB with this platform isn’t possible, regardless of the subscription model you choose. The number of daily conversions, however, is not limited.

### 10\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/webm-to-mp4/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with Aconvert](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-webm-to-mp4.jpg)

 This is a simple online file conversion tool that lets you convert WebM videos that are stored locally on your computer or on the cloud. You just have to select the source from which you want to import the video, select the output format and decide if you want to change the [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or size.

 When done, simply click on the Convert Now button and then after the conversion process is completed, proceed to download your video to your computer. The only downside is that you cannot convert WebM video files that are larger than 200MB with Aconvert.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.
