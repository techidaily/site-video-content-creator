Downloading Fideo Music Video Show will make you a part of the global community of music video makers, so you can become friends with like-minded people and follow their work. The process of making a music video with Fideo is straightforward since you only have to select a song from the app's music library that contains thousands of sounds and songs and record the lip-sync video. The video editing features enable you to polish your videos in any way you want and share it with other Fideo users to get likes and comments.

Even though the app offers a decent amount of video editing options, it lacks the cool visual effects, apps like TikTok Including Musical.ly or Video Star offer. What's more, Fideo's file sharing options are limited as you can't share your videos on other social media networks.
