**1\. Which 3D Movie Maker software is the easiest to use?**

All the video editing tools you can see here are easy to use. However, Autodesk MotionBuilder and Blender are better for people who are experienced. Beginners can try Vidmore Video Converter and Tipard video converter.

**2\. Should I use 3D Movie Maker freeware or paid ones?**

It depends on your requirements. Both paid and freeware video editing tools will allow you to edit your 3D animation videos, but if you have additional requirements and looking for an advanced video editing tool, paid ones will be better suitable. Consider the video requirements you have, and accordingly choose a paid or freeware 3D video editor.
