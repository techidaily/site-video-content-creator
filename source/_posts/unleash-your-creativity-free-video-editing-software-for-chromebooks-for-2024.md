## How to Flip a Clip in Final Cut Pro

As one of the most popular professional video editing software, Final Cut Pro is an easy-to-use software that can enable you to fully customize your videos by flipping, rotating and doing all sorts of editing tasks. Follow the below simple steps to flip, crop, resize or move clips.

#### Step 1: Select a Clip on the Timeline

The timeline is at the bottom portion of the Final Cut Pro. After adding clips to the timeline, you can add tittles and texts as well to these clips before integrating them into your videos.

#### Step 2:  Access the Transform Option

There is a popup menu for you to get the **Transform** tool. It is in the lower-left corner of the viewer so it should be easy to see. You can use the shortcut as well which can be done by pressing (shift-T). Or Control-click in the viewer and choose Transform.

There are **blue handles at each corner** which enable the user to adjust image size while **maintaining the aspect ratio of the photo.**

* The Scale option is for resizing the image. Click the small arrow alongside it and then you will see X and Y options. To flip the video clip, just enter-1oo in the X sidebar and press the **Enter** key. You will see then the selected clip in the timeline will be flipped horizontally to another direction.
