## Bonus! Remove watermark from your videos

Removing a watermark isn’t bad, especially when you put in a lot of effort to create and edit the video. Watermarking means that the person using or handling the video is not the rightful owner; this is possible with the help of tags or logos. Luckily, there are simple ways to help remove watermarks from any video. However, some of this software is easy to use; you to edit the video file before uploading it to YouTube or any platform of your choice. Below are two simple steps to remove a watermark from a video:

### 1\. Remove Watermark with the Crop tool

This method will entirely remove the watermark from your movie, but it will also crop out a portion of the video that contains the watermark. It might not work well with all video options, so you might lose some vital parts of the video frame. However, you can use Wondershare Filmora software to crop out the edges containing the watermark.

By this, import your video, right-click on the timeline, zoom the video and click on “crop” to manually trim the edges to your chosen size or use the automatic option to select a ratio. Now adjust the edges of the cropping box to remove the watermark. You’ve successfully erased a watermark from your movie by clicking OK to apply the cropping effect.

However, one of the setbacks is that you will have to cut out some parts of the video, and it does not work if the watermark is in any other position other than the corners.

### 2\. Apowersoft Website

Apowersoft is a web-based platform that allows you to remove watermark from video clips and images in very few steps.

* Click on the “Erase button” to crop out the watermark section.
* Finally, download it to your PC.

#### **Difference between Rewind and Reverse:**

#### **Reverse:**

The word reverse as the name reflects, means that we can play a video from its end towards the initial position. Yes, it is possible to reverse the order of video frames in order to arrange them in such a way that last frame appears first following the reverse sequence so that first frame goes to the last position in the clip.

#### **Rewind:**

On the other side rewind is also an interesting feature for video editing where users simply duplicate the clip in form of a segment or make adjustments over range selection and then rewind that particular segment at a speed many times faster than the original speed of clip. After this they play segment of original clip in normal speed towards forward direction.

Although it is possible to get the rewind effect in videos with simple reverse option but still Apple platform supports both of these as standalone options.

## How to reverse a clip in Final Cut Pro

You might have heard about Retiming effect in videos where we either speed up our clip or slow it down by certain time factor so that a desired effect can be achieved. There are two types of retiming effects: Variable speed type and constant speed format. FCP is capable enough to merge the reverse option with retiming effects so that something innovative can be developed even with simple editing efforts.

#### **Step 1:**

First of all go to timeline and then select the desired clip from your collection that you want to reverse. It is also possible to apply this effect on a group of clips as per need.

#### **Step 2:**

## Top 10 Mac Video Tag Editors for Seamless Organization

# 8 Best Video Metadata Editor on Mac (Real and Easy)

Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.

## 8 Best Video Metadata Editors for Mac

### 1. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Metadata is the pieces of information that help viewers understand what a video is about without having to watch it from start to finish. Things like titles, keywords, tags, timestamps, and descriptions are some metadata that should be added to a video before it is published online.

Adding the right metadata to your video is useful for many reasons. It makes it easy for search engines to correctly identify and index your video. This in turn helps viewers find your video when they search Google, iTunes, or video sharing platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.

For more experienced videographers, metadata is useful at every stage of the process of making a video, from production to post-production and publishing. Without the right metadata, professional video production and editing would be a very uphill task.

The best multimedia editors have metadata editing features. It’s also good to have a lightweight, standalone application to edit and customize video metadata quickly. In this post, we share the 8 best video metadata editors for macOS users.
