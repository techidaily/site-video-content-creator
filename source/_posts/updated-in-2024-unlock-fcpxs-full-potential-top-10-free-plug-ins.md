After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose "Delete".

To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit "Create" to export it.
