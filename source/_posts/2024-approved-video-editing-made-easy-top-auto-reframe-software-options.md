## Home video editing tips for better home movie making

### 1\. Know your camcorder well

### 3\. Shoot good videos

 Make sure your videos have plenty of light and are not blurry. And be conscious of the background sound, and try to control it as much as possible. Besides, try to shoot scenes from different angles.

### 4\. Add video editing effects

 When you are editing your movies using some [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can trim, split, rotate, split videos before or after using the PIP, Jump-cut, Face Off effects, but do not use too many transition effects.

### 6\. Don't make the home video too long

 Most home videos are long and boring. However, people usually don't like to see very trifle. So make your home video short, sweet and attractive. Get the best scenes and discard those trivial things.

### 7\. Get some humor

 Successful TV commercials are with good humor and make people happy. Adding some humor to your home videos will bring them to the next level instantly. You can find some funny video online and find some inspirations from them on how to make the video funny and attractive.
