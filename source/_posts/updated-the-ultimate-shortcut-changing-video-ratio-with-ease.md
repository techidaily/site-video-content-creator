While using online tools is far more convenient, they do have their downsides too!

Did you know that an online tool has an 80% more probability of getting hacked? That means any videos you upload to the online tool are at risk of being exposed to dangerous hackers. Additionally, in online tools, you have numerous restrictions in terms of file sizes, formats, and the options available. If you do not subscribe to the tool, then chances are that you will not be able to use all the functions of that tool! However, there is one solution. Wondershare Filmora! This application can be downloaded into your Windows and Mac devices!
