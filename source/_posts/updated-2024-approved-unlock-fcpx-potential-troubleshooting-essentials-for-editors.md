# Troubleshooting Tips for Final Cut Pro X

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most of the time, Final Cut Pro X works great. But, when it doesn't, here are some things you can try to get your system back to normal in no time.

Here's the quick list:

* [Quit and restart Final Cut Pro](#part1)
* [Check your media](#part2)
* [Delete render files and re-render](#part3)
* [Create a new library](#part4)
* [Create a new user account](#part5)
* [Trash FCP X Preferences](#part6)
* [Remove and re-install Final Cut Pro](#part7)

#### 1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro

Restarting Final Cut releases and refreshes memory so that if something was confusing your system, restarting Final Cut can fix it.

![restart fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/restart.png "restart fcp")

#### 2 Check your media

![check your media](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/image-size.png "check your media")

Frequently, problems are caused by still images that are too big. Limit your digital photos to no more than 5,000 pixels on a side. Final Cut is a video editor, not a still image editor. Images that are too large cause problems.

Also, stock footage files are known to cause problems. Be sure to convert all stock footage to ProRes 422 before importing into Final Cut Pro X.

#### 3 Delete render files and re-render

Open your Project in the Timeline and choose File > Delete Project Render Files. Render files can become corrupt. Trashing them forces Final Cut to create new render files which often will fix the problem.

#### 4 Create a new library

Create a new library and a new project. Then, copy and paste sections of the old project into the new project. Test each section until you find the spot that doesn't work. At which point, you can remove or replace the bad media.

![Create a new library](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-project.png "Create a new library")

#### 5 Create a new user account

![Create a new user account](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-ccount.png "Create a new user account")

Open System Preferences > Accounts and create a new User Account. This resets all preferences for both Final Cut and the operating system back to factory defaults. The only problem with doing this is that a new user account can't access files stored in the Home directory of the old user account. For this reason, I always recommend storing all libraries on external hard drives, not the Home Directory.

#### 6 Trash FCP X Preferences

Trash Final Cut Pro X preference files. There are at least three preference files and, if you've had a crash, there can be more. Here are the steps:

* Go to the Finder.
* Hold down on the Option key and click on the Go menu. The Library folder inside your Home Directory now shows up as a selection inside this menu. (You could also type Shift+Command+G, or select Go > Go To Folder in the Finder; then, type \~/Library/ and click Go.)
* Open to the Library > Preferences folder.
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.LSSharedFileList.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.UserDestinations.plist
* Trash any other files that start with "com.apple.finalcut".
* Empty the Trash.
* Restart Final Cut Pro X.

#### 7 Remove and reinstall Final Cut Pro

If all else fails, delete FCPX from the Applications folder and re-install it from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12).

One of these techniques should fix your problem. If not, it's time to contact [Apple Support](http://www.apple.com/support/).

**\# Recommendation:**

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

GIFs are stealing the show all across the internet. The cool repetition of frames is perfect for catching attention and wooing your audience. You can use GIFs on websites, social media, chats, and a number of channels. No wonder everybody is mad about GIFs!

Many among us now make and edit GIFs to upload on various websites. You will need to create GIF loops to control how your GIFs play online. Here are the best GIF loop maker tools for you to give expression to your creativity.

## Part 1: Best FREE GIF Infinite Loop Maker Online

If you prefer to create a looping GIF online without downloading any [gif makers on a computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or smartphone, you should try the following [online gif makers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).![Media.io download loop gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-io-image-to-gif-download.jpg)

### 2. EZGIF.com

EZGIF is a simple loop maker for basic needs. You can create **infinite loops** or select a finite number of repetitions. EZGIF is suitable for casual use and lets you add a few effects to your GIFs. However, you can't perform advanced functions. So, the tool is not ideal for professional use.

The good part is, you can quickly create GIF loops from your browser. The whole thing is online and totally free. Let's take you over the process of creating an infinite GIF loop in EZGIF.

1. Head over to the [EZGIF website](https://ezgif.com/maker) in your browser and click the "GIF Maker" tab on top of the page.

2. Click the "Make a GIF" button to save changes, and your looping GIF is ready.

You can also change the loop count by using the [EZGIF loop count changer](https://ezgif.com/loop-count). Just upload your GIF and provide the loop count or choose an infinite loop.
