Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free...until you download their software and it tries to charge you.

Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.

But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.

## What Is an IP Camera?

When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.

Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.

However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet/meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn't need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.

## What Is Camera Software Used for?

Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?

In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn't allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.

For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.

## 10 Best Free Security Camera Software

Now let’s have a look at the 10 best free security camera software with very comprehensive choosing details.

#### 1. [NetCam Studio](https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/netcam-studio.jpg)

There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.

After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn't be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.

**The NetCam Studio Features**

If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.

The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.

**Pros**

The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications

You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands

Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs

**Cons**

The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly

They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure

Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult

#### 2. [Security Eye](https://www.security-eye-software.com/)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/security-eye.jpg)

The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).

**Security Eye Features**

You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.

**Pros**

It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec

The full version has no nag screen or recording limit

The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software

**Cons**

Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space

Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor

The icons should be more intuitive

#### 3. [Perfect Surveillance](https://www.perfect-surveillance.com/)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perfect-surveillance.jpg)

There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.

**Perfect Surveillance Features**

Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.

**Pros**

A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner

Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do

The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices

**Cons**

Installing seems overly long and bloated

There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected

They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots

#### 4. [iVideon](https://www.ivideon.com/)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ivideon.jpg)

There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.

**iVideon Features**

One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.

**Pros**

Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware

It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps

it doesn't take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface

**Cons**

Seems rather light on features

Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial

Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems

#### 5. [Xeoma](https://felenasoft.com/xeoma/en/)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xeoma.jpg)

This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.

**Xeoma Features**

The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.

**Pros**

Record and monitor from four cameras

Updates are very frequent

This software works with mostly every type of camera

**Cons**

Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.

Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up

Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole

#### 6. [Genius Vision](http://geniusvision.net/community.html)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/genius-vision.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116" border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.

**Genius Vision Features**

There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.

**Pros**

Works in-depth with many types of camera

The tools are very sophisticated and accurate

The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out

**Cons**

Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website

Setting up the remote features is difficult

You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected

#### 7. [Deskshare IP Camera Viewer](https://www.deskshare.com/ip-camera-viewer.aspx)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deskshare.gif)

The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.

**Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features**

Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.

**Pros**

It is compatible with many types of camera brand

You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want

Adjust the properties of each camera individually

**Cons**

Installing is very difficult to do correctly

Comes with bloatware and/or unwanted content

The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software

#### 8. [Anycam](https://anycam.io/)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/anycam.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.

**Anycam Features**

Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.

**Pros**

The program seems to work with any type of camera

Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates

Installing and setup is very easy

**Cons**

Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly

The free version only allows two cameras to be linked

The recording is very limited with the free version

#### 9. [ContaCam](https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contacam.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=32667153&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.coolmuster.com/uploads/image/20201228/feature02.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.

**ContaCam Features**

Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.

**Pros**

A rather advanced piece of software

The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing

You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds

**Cons**

The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all

ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing

The developers say this will never work with mobile devices

#### 10. [Agent DVR](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Security-Related/Agent-DVR.shtml)

![best free security camera software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/agent-dvr.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958374/18409" target="_top" id="1958374"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958374" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958374/18409" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.

**Agent DVR Features**

The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.

**Pros**

A very simple and lightweight piece of software

Works all the way back to Windows 7

It still works with motion detection systems

**Cons**

Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years

Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10

The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software

## Conclusion

As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.

Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?

Have any of these worked for you? Ask your friends on social media, start a discussion, and share this article to help others discover the best free security camera software.
