While most videos nowadays are rectangular, and are recorded in either landscape or portrait orientation, there are some social media platforms that require the clips to be square shaped. If you want to upload your footages on such websites, it is essential to learn **how to change video shape**.

Another benefit of changing the shape of the recorded films is that they can be adjusted in limited amount of space, especially if they are to be posted on a website. Furthermore, some fancy designs such as star-shaped or circle-shaped videos attract more attention when used in digital marketing campaigns.

With that said, here you will learn **how to change the shape of a video** using one of the most advanced and versatile post-production tools, Wondershare Filmora.

Or, you just want to [transfer your video into vertical.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: How to Change Video Shape from Rectangle to Square

Depending on the recording device and the target audiences a video is intended to be distributed to, the aspect ratio of the produced footage could be 16:9, 4:3, or 21:9 that makes the film rectangular-shaped. Given that, the aspect ratio can be modified to change the film shape from rectangle to square.

The instructions given below explain **how to change video shape** from rectangle to square in Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Video to Timeline**

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC (a Windows 10 computer is used here), click the **Add Files** icon from the center of the **Media** window present at the upper-left section, and use the **Open** box that appears to select and import the source video to Filmora. Next, drag the video from the **Media** window to the Timeline, and select your preferred option when/if the **Project Setting** confirmation box appears.

**Step 2: Change Aspect Ratio**

Select the video in the Timeline, and click the **Crop and Zoom** icon from the upper-left area of the Timeline itself. On the **Crop and Zoom** window that opens next, select **1:1** from the **Ratio** drop-down list, and click **OK** to save the new setting.

**Step 3: Export the Video**

Click **EXPORT** from the top-center area of the interface, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** box, select your preferred format from the **Format** list in the left pane, optionally click **SETTINGS** from the right window to make other adjustments if necessary, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner of the box.

For more details, please refer to this article: [How to Resize a Video to Right Aspect Ratio and Size.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 2: Change Video Shape by Cropping

If your preferred aspect ratio isn’t available in the ‘Ratio’ drop-down list of the ‘Crop and Zoom’ window, Wondershare Filmora allows you to manually change the video to a custom shape.

**Step 4: Export the Video**

## Part 3: Change Video Shape to Circle or Other Shapes in Filmora

That said, following are the instructions to apply both types of masking to your videos:

#### Image Masking

You can double-click any of the available shape presets to apply it to the video layer. In addition, drag the **X** and **Y**, and **Width**, **Height**, and **Feather** sliders to adjust the mask’s position, size, and edge smoothness respectively. You can also check the **Invert Mask** box to reverse the masking effect on the video. Finally, click **OK** to save the changes, and follow the method explained in earlier parts to export the video.

### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

#### In this article

01 [What is OGG?](#Part 1)

02 [Eight Online and Free OGG to MP4 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What is OGG?

### 01What Does OGG Means?

OGG is a file format that was developed by the Xiph Foundation, specifically for encoding audio and video file types. It is freely available and open-source. This format can be used by anyone with the right skills and knowledge. Additionally, file formats like this can contain not only the audio data but also video, text (like subtitles), and metadata related to the audio. It is a credit to the word 'Jargon,' which is slang for slang used on the computer game Netrek.

### 02Is OGG Better Than MP3?

OGG (or Open Source Graphics) is a popular audio file format. These are often preferred over MP3 as the files are easily readable and can have equal quality thru conversions. For better understanding, let's have a look at other related details for both MP3 and OGG:-

**●** Both OGG & MP3 are compressed formats, but they have distinct differences. OGG files are smaller and less lossy, you will get higher quality with OGG files, and sometimes you can hear the difference even under close-to-same levels of compression.

**●** OGG is a file format that can only be developed by resource-rich companies. But it has huge benefits, such as being free, open, and owned by the public.

**●** OGG is an audio codec that uses a variable bit rate, which enables it to preserve bandwidth.

**●** MP3 is right up there with other formats when it comes to quality and size, but the OGG format compresses files into smaller sizes and maintains a better quality than the MP3 file.

**●** OGG files have a bit rate of several hundred Kbps, whereas MP3 format only reaches up to 320 Kbps. The difference, however, should not be too big of a concern.

### 03How to Play OGG Files?

When you are looking forward to playing the OGG files, it is important to convert them. Most devices available do not support the file format, due to which you cannot play them directly. Maybe the operating system at which you are using the device may support it but if it is not, look out for converter tools.

### 04Which Other Formats OGG Can Be Converted into and Why

Different formats are available in which you can convert OGG like MP4, WEBM and AVI and so on. The reason behind doing the conversion is that devices do not allow users to play the content directly due to the lack of features in them.

**Compatibility:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/GATM-meme-generator-android-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful meme generator this app also offers an easy way to discover new memes. The browsable content is updated daily, so you'll always be in touch with the latest meme trends.

The app features a huge template library, and you can upload your own images too. The GATM Meme Generator can be downloaded for free, but the text formatting tools offer only basic options. All generated memes are watermark-free and they can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, or numerous other social media platforms directly from the app.

#### 2. [Mematic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.trilliarden.mematic&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![Meme Maker App](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mematic> -the-meme-maker.jpg)

Over 100.000 installs on Google Play show just how good this meme generator really is. Mematic is designed to create memes quickly and effortlessly, so you can just add captions and share the meme with your friends.

The app only offers basic text formatting tools, and there are no photo editing options. However, downloading Mematic for free will enable you to gain access to hundreds of classic meme pictures to which you can add your captions. The app's interface is intuitive so you won't have any problems making memes, even if you never used the Mematic app before.

#### 3. [Memedroid](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memedroid-funny-memes-gifs/id549014460?mt=8)

Memedroid is both a meme generator and a community of people who enjoy a good laugh. It features a rich meme template library and just basic text tools. There are very few extra features other than support for uploading your own images and GIFs.

Despite this, the Memedroid app is a great source of new meme templates because the gallery is constantly updated. If you decide to install this app on your device, be prepared to deal with annoying ads on a regular basis. Don't be too surprised if the app crashes while you are browsing through the latest memes.

#### 4. [ZomboDroid's Meme Generator Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.MemeGenerator&hl=en)

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ZomboDroid-meme-generator-free.jpg)

Neatly organized memes into separate categories, stickers, excellent file sharing features, and memes without watermarks are only a few reasons why the Meme Generator Free app is so popular. As its name suggests, you don't have to pay anything to install the app and use its library that has over 700 memes.

You can choose the size of the header and footer, use a font you like, or crop images in just a few easy steps. The only unpleasant thing about this app is the ads because every other option makes the meme-generating process fun.

#### 5. [Tumblr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tumblr)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tumblr-make-memes.jpg)

Tumblr is a social network, so you can create an account and post images and videos on your profile. The app for iPhones and Android Smartphones features a GIF editor as well as photo editing options. You can customize text by selecting the font, the size and the color or add as many stickers as you want to your memes.

Besides memes, you can use Tumblr to discover all types of images from pet photos to cars or fashion photos. All memes must be first posted to this social network before they can be shared on your other social media channels.

#### 6. [ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.videogifmemefreegplay&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android

The coolest memes are always GIFs, and if you want a powerful app that lets you manipulate moving and still images then ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes is one of the best options. You can customize the text in any way you want while the app also lets you combine videos, GIFs, and photos into a single file.

The library contains millions of GIFs you can freely use to create your own hilarious memes. You can control the frame rate, speed or repetition of each GIF you edit with this incredibly fun app.

#### 7. [Meme Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gentoozero.memecreator)

Curate your own collection of memes or create new memes using the Meme Creator's rich library that contains over 600 memes.

Meme Creator lets you share memes on all popular online destinations, which makes it a great choice for all Android owners who post fresh content every day on multiple social media profiles.

#### 8. [Meme Producer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meme-producer-free-meme-maker-generator/id560797323?mt=8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

Share memes in three simple steps. Choose a picture, add a caption and share a meme on any popular social media platform. Meme Producer lets you combine several images in a single meme and enables you to change a caption with a single tap.

Captions generated with this app can have more than one line, which is great if the text you want to add contains more than two sentences. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore and it contains no ads or watermarks.

#### 9. [Modern Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dinizthiagobrdev.ModernMemeMaker)

**Compatibility:** Android

The app lets you browse and use over 200 free meme templates. You just have to select the meme you like and decide which color or the size the text is going to be. You don't have to worry about the length of the caption because the multi-line feature is available.

If you want, you can add watermarks to memes, although watermarked memes are not particularly popular. The best part is that Modern Meme Maker supports Instagram's upload requirements, while it also lets you share memes on Twitter or Tumblr.

#### 10. [Make a Meme +](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-a-meme+/id513930217?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

With more than 4 million users and an extensively long list of memes, this app is among the very best meme generators for iPhones. Changing the text requires you to just tap on a meme you like, while you can also add faces or hats to images you're editing.

The text formatting tools are not as powerful as you'd expect from an app that offers so many other cool features. All images can either be saved to the camera roll or shared on Facebook, Instagram, and other popular online destinations.

---

#### **Conclusion:**

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want. A good meme generator app will help you forget about the technical side of the meme-making process so you can focus on what is truly important.

## 10 Best Meme Generator Apps for Android and iOS

Choosing a meme generator is not easy because there are simply too many great apps for both iOS and Android devices that let you have complete control over the entire process of generating a meme. We've selected the 12 best options that are currently available on GooglePlay and AppStore.

#### 1. [GATM Meme Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iddqd.gatm)

**Compatibility:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/GATM-meme-generator-android-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful meme generator this app also offers an easy way to discover new memes. The browsable content is updated daily, so you'll always be in touch with the latest meme trends.

The app features a huge template library, and you can upload your own images too. The GATM Meme Generator can be downloaded for free, but the text formatting tools offer only basic options. All generated memes are watermark-free and they can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, or numerous other social media platforms directly from the app.

#### 2. [Mematic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.trilliarden.mematic&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![Meme Maker App](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mematic> -the-meme-maker.jpg)

Over 100.000 installs on Google Play show just how good this meme generator really is. Mematic is designed to create memes quickly and effortlessly, so you can just add captions and share the meme with your friends.

The app only offers basic text formatting tools, and there are no photo editing options. However, downloading Mematic for free will enable you to gain access to hundreds of classic meme pictures to which you can add your captions. The app's interface is intuitive so you won't have any problems making memes, even if you never used the Mematic app before.

#### 3. [Memedroid](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memedroid-funny-memes-gifs/id549014460?mt=8)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/memedroid-funny-memes-gif-maker.jpg)

Memedroid is both a meme generator and a community of people who enjoy a good laugh. It features a rich meme template library and just basic text tools. There are very few extra features other than support for uploading your own images and GIFs.

Despite this, the Memedroid app is a great source of new meme templates because the gallery is constantly updated. If you decide to install this app on your device, be prepared to deal with annoying ads on a regular basis. Don't be too surprised if the app crashes while you are browsing through the latest memes.

#### 4. [ZomboDroid's Meme Generator Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.MemeGenerator&hl=en)

**Compatibility** **:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ZomboDroid-meme-generator-free.jpg)

Neatly organized memes into separate categories, stickers, excellent file sharing features, and memes without watermarks are only a few reasons why the Meme Generator Free app is so popular. As its name suggests, you don't have to pay anything to install the app and use its library that has over 700 memes.

You can choose the size of the header and footer, use a font you like, or crop images in just a few easy steps. The only unpleasant thing about this app is the ads because every other option makes the meme-generating process fun.

#### 5. [Tumblr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tumblr)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tumblr-make-memes.jpg)

Tumblr is a social network, so you can create an account and post images and videos on your profile. The app for iPhones and Android Smartphones features a GIF editor as well as photo editing options. You can customize text by selecting the font, the size and the color or add as many stickers as you want to your memes.

Besides memes, you can use Tumblr to discover all types of images from pet photos to cars or fashion photos. All memes must be first posted to this social network before they can be shared on your other social media channels.

#### 6. [ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.videogifmemefreegplay&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android

The coolest memes are always GIFs, and if you want a powerful app that lets you manipulate moving and still images then ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes is one of the best options. You can customize the text in any way you want while the app also lets you combine videos, GIFs, and photos into a single file.

The library contains millions of GIFs you can freely use to create your own hilarious memes. You can control the frame rate, speed or repetition of each GIF you edit with this incredibly fun app.

#### 7. [Meme Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gentoozero.memecreator)

**Compatibility:** Android

Curate your own collection of memes or create new memes using the Meme Creator's rich library that contains over 600 memes. The color of the captions and their size can be easily adjusted to meet your aesthetic demands. There are more than 20 different fonts available and you can also combine memes to create comics.

Meme Creator lets you share memes on all popular online destinations, which makes it a great choice for all Android owners who post fresh content every day on multiple social media profiles.

#### 8. [Meme Producer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meme-producer-free-meme-maker-generator/id560797323?mt=8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

Share memes in three simple steps. Choose a picture, add a caption and share a meme on any popular social media platform. Meme Producer lets you combine several images in a single meme and enables you to change a caption with a single tap.

Captions generated with this app can have more than one line, which is great if the text you want to add contains more than two sentences. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore and it contains no ads or watermarks.

#### 9. [Modern Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dinizthiagobrdev.ModernMemeMaker)

**Compatibility:** Android

The app lets you browse and use over 200 free meme templates. You just have to select the meme you like and decide which color or the size the text is going to be. You don't have to worry about the length of the caption because the multi-line feature is available.

If you want, you can add watermarks to memes, although watermarked memes are not particularly popular. The best part is that Modern Meme Maker supports Instagram's upload requirements, while it also lets you share memes on Twitter or Tumblr.

#### 10. [Make a Meme +](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-a-meme+/id513930217?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

With more than 4 million users and an extensively long list of memes, this app is among the very best meme generators for iPhones. Changing the text requires you to just tap on a meme you like, while you can also add faces or hats to images you're editing.

The text formatting tools are not as powerful as you'd expect from an app that offers so many other cool features. All images can either be saved to the camera roll or shared on Facebook, Instagram, and other popular online destinations.

---

#### **Conclusion:**

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want. A good meme generator app will help you forget about the technical side of the meme-making process so you can focus on what is truly important. What's your favorite meme generator app for iOS or Android devices? Wanna be more creative in making memes and level up your video editing experience, download Filmora for free and make memes and videos with fun.
