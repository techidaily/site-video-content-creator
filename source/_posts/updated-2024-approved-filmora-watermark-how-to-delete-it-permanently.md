Movie Rotator 2.0 is specifically for those that have upgraded their operating systems to Windows 7 or 8\. If you are still using XP or Vista you should stick to the old version.

 What we liked about Rotate Video was the ability to rotate at just about any angle, with one simple click of your mouse. It supports all the major file formats including MPG, WMV or MP4 to name a few and it is remarkably simple to use. The only drawback we found was the 5MB limit on file size!

 Very easy to use and a simple interface, this software does more than simply rotate your videos.

It's a bit of all-singing, all-dancing rotating software as it also supports a huge amount of file formats, including MOV of course.

It supports a whole lot more formats than Movie Rotator and can even support the iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad as well as the usual MOV, MP4 and WMV file formats. Video Rotator 1.0.7 can even supports mass flipping of videos, so if you have around 50 or more to do, it'll rotate them all.

![free mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-rotator.jpg "free mov video rotator")

**Pros:**

* Supports various video formats;
* Straightforward and easy-to-use.

**Cons:**

* Crashed occasionally.

#### [Rotate Video](http://www.rotatevideo.org/)

 What we liked about Rotate Video was the ability to rotate at just about any angle, with one simple click of your mouse. It supports all the major file formats including MPG, WMV or MP4 to name a few and it is remarkably simple to use. The only drawback we found was the 5MB limit on file size!

![free video roator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/rotate-video.jpg "free video roator")

**Pros:**

* Supported various video formats;
* No need to download.

**Cons:**

* 5MB limit on file size.

#### [Freemake Video Converter](http://www.freemake.com/)

 This is a very easy piece of software to use and enables anyone to easily change the rotation of your movies. It supports various video formats like MOV, AVI, MP4, WMV, MKV, 3GP and more. Once you get going it's easy to use, straightforward and uncomplicated.

**Pros:**

* Supports various video formats;
* Different video editing options;
* User-friendly interface and easy-to-use.

**Cons:**

* There is a charge to upgrade it to the Gold Version.

#### [Any Video Converter](http://www.any-video-converter.com/products/for%5Fvideo%5Ffree/)

 Very easy to use and a simple interface, this software does more than simply rotate your videos. It will also rotate in batches and allow you to do some smart editing like trimming, cropping, clipping as well as rotating. It's a bit of all-singing, all-dancing rotating software as it also supports a huge amount of file formats, including MOV of course.

![top mov video rotator](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/any-video-converter.jpg "top mov video rotator")

**Pros:**

* Supports almost any video formats;
* Different video editing functions.

**Cons:**

* Can’t convert audio files.

## Canon Camcorder Video Editing Made Easy: Tips, Tricks, and Software

# Canon Camcorder Video Editing Software: How to Edit Canon videos

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Canon camcorders consistently rank among the best camcorder models available to consumers, achieving high marks for image quality, convenience and advanced features. Their superior performance ensures Canon's popularity, even as most smartphones include video recording options.

Canon camcorder owners typically want the ability to edit, adjust and add special effects to their videos. There are a variety of Canon camcorder video editing software solutions, as well as online applications, that offer varying levels of performance and features.

One factor limiting the software or applications used to edit Canon camcorder videos is format: some models only record in .mov format, or among a limited selection of supported formats. Some Canon camcorders have poor performance in low-light situations, requiring adjustment in editing. Color accuracy may also need fixing with video editing software.

## Tips for choosing Canon Camcorder Video Editing Software

How do you choose the right Canon camcorder video editing software? Here are some brief tips to ensure you get the right software to meet your needs:

#### 1.What is your budget?

There are numerous free video editing tools available, although with performance or feature limitations. Do you have the budget to support a paid program that offers advanced features?

#### 2\. Do you need novice accessibility or professional-level performance?

Many free video editing programs that are available online are easy to use and have more than enough capability for novice users. Professional-grade features are only available with paid programs.

#### 3\. What are your format requirements?

A video editing program that supports .mov format is a requirement in almost all circumstances. Check the format your Canon camera records in, as well as the formats you want to create output files and find video editing software that supports both.
