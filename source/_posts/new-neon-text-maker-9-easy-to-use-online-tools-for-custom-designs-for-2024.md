As its name suggests this is a file compression platform that enables its users to resize websites, documents, images, and audio or video files. You can compress up to five WebM videos that can have a maximum size of 200MB at the same time. The platform lets you choose if you want to change overall video quality or specified video parameters, so you should select the second option if you would like to customize the size, bitrate, frame rate and aspect ratio options. Additionally, you can click on the remove all audio tracks checkbox if you don’t want your compressed WebM video to contain sound. The resized WebM video is going to be displayed in the Output Files section of the screen and you just have to click on it if you would like to download it.

Reducing a video’s size with Compressify requires a minimum amount of effort because you just have to upload a WebM video and the platform will do the rest for you. However, the maximum size of a video file you can compress with this online tool is limited to just 8MB which makes it a good choice only if you are compressing short WebM videos. Compressify reduces the size of your video files by 60% while maintaining excellent image quality. Even though the size of WebM videos you upload to this platform cannot exceed 8MB, the file compression process is incredibly slow.
