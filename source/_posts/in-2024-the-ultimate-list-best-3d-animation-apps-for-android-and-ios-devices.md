## Part 3: FAQ about 3D Animation Apps

### 1\. What is the best app for animation?

For the 3D animation app, we suggest using the Bot3D Editor. It is an easy-to-use anime editor that only needs dragging to complete your editing. If you know how to use keyframes, it will give you more control over animation. For example, you can make poses in many ways by keyframes.

### 2\. How do you animate a 3D object?

The best way to animate a 3D object is by using keyframes and built-in templates. As a beginner, you may not know how to make a 3D object, but with templates, you just need to choose one and start customizing it.
