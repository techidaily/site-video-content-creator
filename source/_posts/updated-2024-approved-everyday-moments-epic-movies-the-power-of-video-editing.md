## Part 1: Best Basic Video Editors for Windows and Mac \[Free and Paid\]

What should you do when you do not have access to a video studio or a team of video experts on staff to film and edit your videos? Do not be concerned!

Without the need for an in-house team or outsourcing your video brand awareness, it's quicker than ever to make high-quality films on your own. Here are some of the top picks.

### 1\. Windows Photos App

Microsoft Photos, a free digital viewer and video editor included with Windows 10 and Windows 11, provides capable visual effects and video enhancements, as well as techniques for organizing and editing videos, everything in a touch-friendly functionality. Windows 10/11 comes with the Photos app pre-integrated. You don't have to do anything to obtain the app when you have Windows 10/11.

The free Microsoft photo and video editing app is a great choice for viewing, editing, and sharing digital photos and videos. As the name suggests, it's for Windows users – a delight to use a picture and video-editing tool that's simple to use, clean, and has all the functions you need for basic viewing and repairs. Obviously, a full-featured program like the Windows Photos App is required for advanced photo organizing, optimization, and effects.

![windows photos app interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-photos-app-interface.jpg)

Clips may be trimmed or divided, [text can be added](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), motion or 3D effects can be applied, filters can be used, and the [speed can be changed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It's a huge array that allows you to create an interesting result. There are over 20 options for [adding soundtracks](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at the backend at the top.

The Photos app features the Automatic Video tool which can [create video automatically with the images or videos uploaded](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

Okay, so this one won't actually apply to those of you who deal with computers, but we'd be negligent if we left it off the roster. Thanks to its high-class interface, it doesn't get much nicer than Apple iMovie regarding elegance and beauty. It is only supported by macOS and iOS.

The ten [high-fidelity filters in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are among the best in the video editing game, and you can utilize AirDrop to instantly and smoothly transmit your video to your Mac when you're filming on your iPhone or working on your iPad.

![imovie editing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-editing-interface.jpg)

[Green-screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or "chroma-key," is among iMovie's most prized tools since it enables you to relocate your characters to exotic locations—say, Hawaii—at any time. Do you want to add "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" to the image? Because iMovie is integrated with iTunes and GarageBand, you may quickly add unique music and sounds to your movie. Once your video is finished, send it out into the world via iMessage, Facebook, YouTube, or any of iMovie's numerous easily accessible venues.

Here are some tips and tricks in editing videos with iMovie, hope that will help you edit faster.

### 3\. [Apple Photos App](https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/)

Apple Photos, a free app included with macOS and iOS, is our pick for the best basic video editing software for Mac and iOS users because it embodies the company's concept of fun, easy-to-use software. The interface of Apple Photos is clean, straightforward, and direct, allowing you to express yourself using basic, uncomplicated shortcuts rather than the complex layers of capabilities seen in more feature-rich products. It is only supported by Apple devices only.

Years, collections, and Moments are used to arrange the videos. Only current devices with 64-bit CPUs, such as the iPhone 5s or above, is compliant with the new release of Apple Photos. The Apple Photos mobile application includes thumbnail sliders to switch numerous characteristics of a photo quickly, in addition to options for auto-enhance, red-eye removal, and crop/rotate.

In Adjust, for example, you may move an indicator over a thumbnail variant to change the video's luminance or color intensity. The one-click filters are basic, but they can provide some interesting results. You can also use your fingers or type text on display to mark up a video, trim a video and save it as a short teaser, change the slow-motion segment of a film, and trim a video and save it as a new video.
