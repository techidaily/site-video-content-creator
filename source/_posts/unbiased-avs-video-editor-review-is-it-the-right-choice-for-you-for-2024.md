The increase in popularity of Chromebooks, over the past several years is more than justified because these devices have proven that they are much more than just a web-browsing tool. Using a Chromebook for educational purposes or to widen your network of business associates is becoming more common, while new upgrades of the OS bring improvements at an astounding rate.

However, editing visual content isn't that easy for Chromebook users, because Windows or Mac applications can't be used that easily on these devices. That is the reason why online video editors play a large role for all Chromebook owners who want to create videos that meet at least some of the professional standards. Luckily, currently, there is a large number of online video editors available that can offer a solid video editing experience to users who would like to piece their video clips together into visually attractive content.
