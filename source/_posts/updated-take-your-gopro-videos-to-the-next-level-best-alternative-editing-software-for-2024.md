## Top Subtitle Editors for Mac: Best Alternatives to Subtitle Edit

# Subtitle Edit for Mac: Download Alternatives

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg)

##### Max Wales

Subtitle Edit is a free, open-source subtitle editor that allows users to create, adjust, sync, and translate the subtitle lines seamlessly. But one of the significant drawbacks of Subtitle Edit is that it is available only for Windows users. Nevertheless, it does not mean that Mac users cannot utilize the same function and feature set. There exists some software that is almost similar to Subtitle Edit. And given that there is no option to download Subtitle Edit for Mac users — you can use its alternative and utilize the same features on a macOS environment.

Read on to find the best Subtitle Edit Alternative to download on Mac.

* [**Part 1: Top 3 Subtitle Edit Alternatives**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Edit Subtitle And Video With Filmora**](#part2)

## Part 1: Top 3 Subtitle Edit Alternatives

After reviewing the tons of subtitle editors on the internet, we have composed a short but best list of the best alternatives of Subtitle Edit software for Mac users. And if you are used to Subtitle Edit and looking for a software that is likely comparable to mighty Subtitle Edit, you can ignore looking at this software. That said, here’s the list:

### 1\. Aegisub

Free, open-source, and cross-platform program, AegiSub is the best alternative of SubtitleEdit because the software is comparable in most standards to the software. In fact, by comparison, AegiSub is substantial compared to the one in question. Including a built-in real-time video preview option, Aegisub allows users to see the look of the text on the videos while editing them. There are multiple options to edit the subtitles; for instance, you can change the size, font, and language based on preference and set it to video with exact timestamps. And given the fact it is a free platform; it is definitely worth a look regardless of whether you like the software or not. For the most part, if you like Aegisub, you will love Subtitle Edit and will not find it tough to utilize Aegisub to edit the subtitles.

![ Aegisub](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-edit-alternarives-aegisub-1.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Free of costs — you can donate if you like the program
* Cross-platform — sign in with a single credentials on across all your devices and work anytime, anywhere
* Multiple style, size, and font options
* Built-in video preview to view the added subtitles

**Cons:**

* Interface needs improvement — instead of downloading the original version, try a version from Github that includes developed and enriched version of the software

**Price: Free software; no hidden fees**

### 2\. Jubler

Another free software, Jubler, is also a viable alternative to Subtitle Edit. Having all the features same as Subtitle Edit, Jubler has enough functions and capability to stand against it with its head held high. One of the most lovable qualities of Jubler is syncing text to match video features that allow users to sync the text to exact timestamps and avoid problems like latency. But that is not it: Jubler also includes an ‘Audio Wave’ feature to let you target different parts of the video and add subtitles conveniently and easily. In all, if you need a simple Subtitle editor for a Mac — Jubler is worth looking at and trying it out. Still, given that it has limited options when it comes to Formats, collaboration, and conversation options, Jubler stands next to AegiSub in our list of best alternatives of Subtitle Edit for Mac.

![Jubler](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-edit-alternarives-jubler-2.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Simple and navigable tool for Mac users to edit the subtitles, sync and match to video conveniently

**Cons:**

* Limited subtitles options available
* No online editor — downloading is must

**Price: Free software; no hidden fees**

### 3\. Subtitle Workshop

Supporting all the subtitle formats and incorporating all the tools that is ever expected from a subtitle editor, Subtitle Workshop accumulates the finest features into a simple and workable interface that allows users to add subtitles, edit, and sync & match to video easily. For instance, Subtitle Workshop allows you to handle both time and frame-based subtitles and edit them to perfection. The user-friendly, multi-lingual, and customizable interface is another likable trait that you will rarely find in the subtitle-editors realm. Not only this, but you can also utilize functions like Bold, Italics, and underline to add those subtle details and make the transcript look like a professional-edited one.

![Subtitle Workshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/subtitle-edit-alternatives-subtitle-workshop-3.jpg)

**Pros:**

* Numerous customizable tools and functions for automatic timing and text manipulations. For instance, you will find automatic durations, spell checking, smart line adjusting, FPS conversion, search and replace, and many more!

**Cons:**

* No cross platform supports

Import and export of files work fine, and it has an easy-to-use interface and supports frame-by-frame edits.

It works perfectly fine on Linux, Windows, and iOS; though you might need to use it with other editing software, the available features are amazing for professional editing. Access to updated features is available to premium users alone, though there’s a free option.

![video trimmer for pc- davinci resolve](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/video-trimmer-for-pc-5.jpg)

##### Pros

The free option is great for personal videos.

Explicit tutorial videos.

Simple features.

##### Cons

It cannot sometimes export due to Fusion editing.

The interface is a bit hard to navigate.

### 7\. Cyberlink PowerDirector

Though desktop video trimmers are amazing, some options make it easy for editors to handle professional projects, and Cyberlink PowerDirector meets that list. Not just as a video trimmer but as a video editing software that supports a wide range of file formats, including MKV, , MP4, M2TS, and XAVC. You can resize for upload on stream sites like YouTube and Vimeo.

Want to try it out? There is an option for a 30-days free trial, with watermarks on edited videos, though. And you can’t save 4K videos too.

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Choosing the best video trimmer for you; desktop or online?

Choosing an online or desktop video trimmer is a decision only you, as a professional, can make. Still, the truth is desktop trimmers work more efficiently than online solutions for a good number of reasons.

Accuracy: Though online video trimmers might look a bit faster than desktop options, it might not give the flexibility to make changes at will like the desktop options.

Efficiency: If you enjoy working without an internet connection, or have issues with a reception where you reside, then the online video trimmers are not for you.

Space: However, online versions are best suited for people using PCs with low storage space and saving space and time. However, if you want to edit generally and not just trim videos alone, most desktop options come with other editing features than trim.

Speed: Also, because you do not have to wait for an internet signal, desktop video trimmers render faster than online video trimmers (though still depending on system speed).

Verdict: It will be best to try desktop video trimmers for major projects. Online solutions are online cool while either doing a test project or for personal use.

## Conclusion

● The fact remains that the efficiency of your editing software or tool has a huge influence on your productivity. And even though choosing the best video trimmer for your next project might seem dicey, following a simple review like this will make it easy to select from the best and try to know what works best for you.
