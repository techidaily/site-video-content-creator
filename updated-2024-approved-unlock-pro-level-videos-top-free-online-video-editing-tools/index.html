<h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.</p>
<p>Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can’t miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.</p>

<p>Clipchamp is a well-known <strong>free online video editing tool</strong>, besides the video editing tools, it <strong>provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder</strong> as well. The best part is that its <strong>intuitive</strong> work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.</p>
<p>Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.</p>
<p>You can select <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides <strong>a built-in guide</strong> so you can make a video with it easily. However, you <strong>need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account</strong> first before using this <strong>all-in-one online video editor</strong>. And the free version is <strong>limited to export at the 480P SD</strong> resolution with <strong>no watermark</strong>. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the <strong>video footage can’t be exported in 4K</strong>. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.</p>

<p>WeVideo is a shared online video creation tool. You can <strong>upload your own videos, photos, music files</strong> from your computer or from social sites such as Google Drive, Facebook, Box, Instagram, Dropbox, etc. to the Media panel, or use the <strong>built-in stock videos, audio, and images</strong> to make a video quickly. However, the stock images, videos, and audio files are limited to Professional and Business plans, you can also choose to use free music and sound effects instead of Premium music.</p>
<p>Besides the <strong>basic trimming and splitting</strong>, WeVideo allows you to <strong>add markers</strong> to the specific clip, static simple text, and callouts to the video, or transitions, background graphics, overlays, or frames.

Besides, <strong>there will be a watermark</strong> in the right upper corner of the video in the Free plan. The same as using Clip Champ, you <strong>need to sign in</strong> before using the WeVideo online video editor.</p>

<p>Wideo is an online video creating site for <strong>creating animated videos, explainer videos</strong> and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. <strong>Sign in first</strong> to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website’s editing service, create a sequence of animations.</p>
<p>Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to <strong>upload your own images</strong> in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.</p>
<p>What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose <strong>video aspect ratio</strong> such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are <strong>a lot of video templates</strong> available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19&#x2F;mo to 79&#x2F;mo.</p>
<p>However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> the video on your computer, you’ll <strong>need to upgrade your plan</strong>. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn’t a free option for you.</p>

<p>PowToon is a great way to create videos that will serve an explanatory purpose. If you need a video that is to serve as a sort of guide or teacher then PowToon is definitely the website you want to use. It allows you to use what is essentially a digital version of paper cut-outs superimposed on colorful backgrounds. The drag and drop style editing leaves you with a video reminiscent of the Common Craft style.</p>
<p>You <strong>need to sign in</strong> to use this online, and it provides <strong>many video templates</strong> available for different situations such as explainer video, marketing video, infographic video, video ads, and presentation. It also allows you to <strong>create 1:1 square, 16:9 horizontal, and 9:16 vertical videos</strong>, you can <strong>upload your own video footage</strong> or use the built-in video sources from Storyblocks. You can choose to select one of PowToon’s many drawings of people and objects, which you can then arrange on a blank canvas or on a colorful background of your choice.</p>
<p>The free version will also <strong>leave a Powtoon branding watermark</strong> on your export video and you can export video up to 3 mins in HD quality, and you can’t download the video as MP4 too.</p>

<p>Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.</p>
<p>It can also <strong>convert</strong> your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI. This online platform allows you to upload videos from a computer or from a URL, it can now handle video files up to 1500MB and that still gives you a lot to play around with, and you can <strong>merge, crop, or cut video</strong> files. The editing features are <strong>simple and limited</strong> but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>sign up</strong> and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is <strong>outdated and not user-friendly</strong> enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be <strong>no real-time preview window</strong> to check the editing progress.</p>

Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?</h4><p>Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.</p>
<p>While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn’t watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn’t intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don’t need many editing features.</p>

From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.</p>
<p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.</p>
<p>However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music &amp; text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.</p>

<p>With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.</p>
<p>Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can’t miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.</p>

<p>Clipchamp is a well-known <strong>free online video editing tool</strong>, besides the video editing tools, it <strong>provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder</strong> as well. The best part is that its <strong>intuitive</strong> work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.</p>
<p>Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.</p>
<p>You can select <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides <strong>a built-in guide</strong> so you can make a video with it easily. However, you <strong>need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account</strong> first before using this <strong>all-in-one online video editor</strong>. And the free version is <strong>limited to export at the 480P SD</strong> resolution with <strong>no watermark</strong>. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the <strong>video footage can’t be exported in 4K</strong>. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.</p>

Besides, <strong>there will be a watermark</strong> in the right upper corner of the video in the Free plan. The same as using Clip Champ, you <strong>need to sign in</strong> before using the WeVideo online video editor.</p>

<p>Wideo is an online video creating site for <strong>creating animated videos, explainer videos</strong> and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. <strong>Sign in first</strong> to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website’s editing service, create a sequence of animations.</p>
<p>Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to <strong>upload your own images</strong> in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.</p>
<p>What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose <strong>video aspect ratio</strong> such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are <strong>a lot of video templates</strong> available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19&#x2F;mo to 79&#x2F;mo.</p>
<p>However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> the video on your computer, you’ll <strong>need to upgrade your plan</strong>. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn’t a free option for you.</p>

<p>PowToon is a great way to create videos that will serve an explanatory purpose. If you need a video that is to serve as a sort of guide or teacher then PowToon is definitely the website you want to use. It allows you to use what is essentially a digital version of paper cut-outs superimposed on colorful backgrounds. The drag and drop style editing leaves you with a video reminiscent of the Common Craft style.</p>
<p>You <strong>need to sign in</strong> to use this online, and it provides <strong>many video templates</strong> available for different situations such as explainer video, marketing video, infographic video, video ads, and presentation. It also allows you to <strong>create 1:1 square, 16:9 horizontal, and 9:16 vertical videos</strong>, you can <strong>upload your own video footage</strong> or use the built-in video sources from Storyblocks. You can choose to select one of PowToon’s many drawings of people and objects, which you can then arrange on a blank canvas or on a colorful background of your choice.</p>
<p>The free version will also <strong>leave a Powtoon branding watermark</strong> on your export video and you can export video up to 3 mins in HD quality, and you can’t download the video as MP4 too.</p>

<p>Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.</p>
<p>It can also <strong>convert</strong> your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI. This online platform allows you to upload videos from a computer or from a URL, it can now handle video files up to 1500MB and that still gives you a lot to play around with, and you can <strong>merge, crop, or cut video</strong> files. The editing features are <strong>simple and limited</strong> but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>sign up</strong> and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is <strong>outdated and not user-friendly</strong> enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be <strong>no real-time preview window</strong> to check the editing progress.</p>

Every time you select an effect, Kizoa will indicate how to do it next, which makes it <strong>easier for beginners</strong>.

<p>The free version does provide <strong>some basic editing features</strong> such as split, trim, crop, add text or resize, and add simple titles, emojis, and callouts, but if you want to do some professional editing, you may <strong>need to</strong> <strong>recommend it to your friends</strong> or <strong>upgrade your account.</strong></p>
<p>You <strong>need to register</strong> for this online platform first before editing. And there is no video footage nor stock music available (maybe it is hidden in the Pro editing mode). You can <strong>share the video</strong> directly to social media platforms such as FB, Twitter, YouTube, or via email. You can also <strong>download the clip</strong> to your desk.

Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?</h4><p>Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.</p>
<p>While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn’t watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn’t intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don’t need many editing features.</p>

From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.</p>
<p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.</p>
<p>However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music &amp; text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.</p>

<p>With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.</p>
<p>Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can’t miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.</p>

<p>Clipchamp is a well-known <strong>free online video editing tool</strong>, besides the video editing tools, it <strong>provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder</strong> as well. The best part is that its <strong>intuitive</strong> work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.</p>
<p>Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.</p>
<p>You can select <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides <strong>a built-in guide</strong> so you can make a video with it easily. However, you <strong>need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account</strong> first before using this <strong>all-in-one online video editor</strong>. And the free version is <strong>limited to export at the 480P SD</strong> resolution with <strong>no watermark</strong>. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the <strong>video footage can’t be exported in 4K</strong>. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.</p>

<p>Wideo is an online video creating site for <strong>creating animated videos, explainer videos</strong> and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. <strong>Sign in first</strong> to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website’s editing service, create a sequence of animations.</p>
<p>Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to <strong>upload your own images</strong> in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.</p>
<p>What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose <strong>video aspect ratio</strong> such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are <strong>a lot of video templates</strong> available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19&#x2F;mo to 79&#x2F;mo.</p>
<p>However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> the video on your computer, you’ll <strong>need to upgrade your plan</strong>. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn’t a free option for you.</p>

<p>You <strong>need to sign in</strong> to use this online, and it provides <strong>many video templates</strong> available for different situations such as explainer video, marketing video, infographic video, video ads, and presentation.

<p>Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.</p>
<p>It can also <strong>convert</strong> your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI. This online platform allows you to upload videos from a computer or from a URL, it can now handle video files up to 1500MB and that still gives you a lot to play around with, and you can <strong>merge, crop, or cut video</strong> files. The editing features are <strong>simple and limited</strong> but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>sign up</strong> and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is <strong>outdated and not user-friendly</strong> enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be <strong>no real-time preview window</strong> to check the editing progress.</p>

But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.</p>
<p>While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn’t watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P.

<p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.</p>
<p>However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music &amp; text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.</p>

<p>With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.</p>
<p>Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can’t miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.</p>

<p>Clipchamp is a well-known <strong>free online video editing tool</strong>, besides the video editing tools, it <strong>provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder</strong> as well. The best part is that its <strong>intuitive</strong> work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.</p>
<p>Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.</p>
<p>You can select <strong>different aspect ratios</strong> such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides <strong>a built-in guide</strong> so you can make a video with it easily. However, you <strong>need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account</strong> first before using this <strong>all-in-one online video editor</strong>. And the free version is <strong>limited to export at the 480P SD</strong> resolution with <strong>no watermark</strong>. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the <strong>video footage can’t be exported in 4K</strong>. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.</p>

You can <strong>upload your own videos, photos, music files</strong> from your computer or from social sites such as Google Drive, Facebook, Box, Instagram, Dropbox, etc. to the Media panel, or use the <strong>built-in stock videos, audio, and images</strong> to make a video quickly.

<p>Wideo is an online video creating site for <strong>creating animated videos, explainer videos</strong> and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. <strong>Sign in first</strong> to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website’s editing service, create a sequence of animations.</p>
<p>Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to <strong>upload your own images</strong> in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.</p>
<p>What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose <strong>video aspect ratio</strong> such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are <strong>a lot of video templates</strong> available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19&#x2F;mo to 79&#x2F;mo.</p>
<p>However, if you want to <strong>download</strong> the video on your computer, you’ll <strong>need to upgrade your plan</strong>. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn’t a free option for you.</p>

The drag and drop style editing leaves you with a video reminiscent of the Common Craft style.</p>
<p>You <strong>need to sign in</strong> to use this online, and it provides <strong>many video templates</strong> available for different situations such as explainer video, marketing video, infographic video, video ads, and presentation. It also allows you to <strong>create 1:1 square, 16:9 horizontal, and 9:16 vertical videos</strong>, you can <strong>upload your own video footage</strong> or use the built-in video sources from Storyblocks.

<p>Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.</p>
<p>It can also <strong>convert</strong> your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI. This online platform allows you to upload videos from a computer or from a URL, it can now handle video files up to 1500MB and that still gives you a lot to play around with, and you can <strong>merge, crop, or cut video</strong> files. The editing features are <strong>simple and limited</strong> but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>sign up</strong> and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is <strong>outdated and not user-friendly</strong> enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be <strong>no real-time preview window</strong> to check the editing progress.</p>

<p>Though it isn’t a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates. You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly. With this online video cutter, you can easily <strong>rotate</strong> the videos to 90, 180 or even 270 degrees, <strong>crop</strong> them, <strong>trim</strong> or apply several professional style editing features to create incredible projects. You can <strong>save the video with the original quality or to 1080P Full HD</strong>.</p>
<p>It can easily handle the <strong>maximum file size of 500MB</strong> and allow users to access any popular media file format with ease. It is free to use and you can access all advanced features even without buying any license.</p>
<p>What I like about this online video editing tool is that <strong>you don’t need to register to use</strong> it and there is also <strong>no watermark</strong> in the saved video. But it would be greater if this online tool can integrate some music and effects as well.</p>

Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?"></a>1. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?</h4><p>Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.</p>
<p>While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn’t watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn’t intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don’t need many editing features.</p>

Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?"></a>2. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?</h4><p>For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.</p>
<p> <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.</p>
<p>However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music &amp; text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.</p>

<h5 id="Benjamin-Arango"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>

<p>The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.</p>
<p>The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video trimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser.

Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.</p>
<p>Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named <strong>Filmora</strong>. it’s very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.</p>

<p>The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.</p>
<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>

<p>The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.</p>
<p>The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.</p>
<p>This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.</p>

<p>The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.</p>
<p>For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.</p>
<h4 id="7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter"><a href="#7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter" class="headerlink" title="7.

                ></p>
<p>This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.</p>
<p>The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn’t lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.</p>

It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.</p>
<p>If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.</p>

<p>This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.</p>
<p>You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.</p>
<p>It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.</p>

<p>This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.</p>
<p>This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best"><a href="#Conclusion-Which-Suits-You-the-Best" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?"></a>Conclusion - Which Suits You the Best?</h2><p>There are tools on this article for most types of trimming jobs. There are tools that will quickly upload and process your smaller videos, which is suitable for people making social media videos. Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.</p>
<p>It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.</p>

<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-1"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-1"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-1" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>

Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.</p>
<p>Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available.

This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.</p>
<p>This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.</p>

<p>The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.</p>
<p>For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.</p>

<p>This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.</p>
<p>The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn’t lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.</p>

<p>This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.</p>
<p>You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.</p>

<p>This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.</p>
<p>It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer. If you are only looking to trim your videos, then there are far simpler ways to do it through the online trimmers listed in this article.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more of an online editor, then maybe you should consider the Clip Champ. Suffice it to say that this is not the best tool for quick and simple video trims because there are other tools listed on this article that are much faster.</p>

<p>This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.</p>
<p>This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you. If you are just looking to trim a file, then the adverts for their services can become annoying. The tool renders and works well on web browsers, so it may be of interest to people who are willing to pay for semi-professional editing tools.</p>

Then, there are tools that will take a large and bulky file, and are good for people who are very conscious about the file output and video quality.</p>
<p>It is a pity that some of these tools ask for money to use their other editing services. But, if you want to trim your videos for free, then all of these tools on this article will help you.</p>

<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-2" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>

<p>The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.</p>
<p>The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video trimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.</p>
<p>Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.</p>
<p>Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named <strong>Filmora</strong>. it’s very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.</p>

<p>The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.</p>
<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>

<p>This tool has a very user-friendly interface. It has the sort of simple interface that beats out websites like SnapChat, WhatsApp and so forth. The website that hosts the tool says that you do not need experience to use their editing tools, and that is probably true. The biggest downside to this tool, and the reason it sits on the number nine spot, is that they will not let you use the tool without signing in.</p>
<p>It may not seem like such a big deal to have to sign into an account, but it is just for marketing purposes. It also allows them to sell you other services that they offer.

<p>This is a great tool with a fairly simple interface. You can see your videos as you trim them. And, you can edit your videos, gone their settings, add text, and so forth. Yet, it is only their simplest functions that are for free. The trimming function is free, but many of the editing tools are not.</p>
<p>This would not normally be a problem, but this website is always dangling its other products and its prices in front of you.

<p>Thanks to strong Internet connections, faster processing technology, and Cloud computing, there are now hundreds of free online video trimmer websites.</p>
<p>Yet, it is difficult to figure out which is the best and which is the worst. Some are just awful, and others are a little suspicious and&#x2F;or malicious.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to figure out which online video trimmer is for you, then here is a list of the 10+ best free online video trimmers.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3"><a href="#Why-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Free Online Video Trimmers?"></a>Why Free Online Video Trimmers?</h2><p>Why would anybody use free “Online” video trimmers when there are so many good offline (downloadable) trimmers a person can use? Windows even has its own installed video trimmer. Simply right click your video, navigate to “Open With” and then click on “Photos.” At the top right of the GUI is an icon called “Edit &amp; Create.” Click it and it takes you to the editing function where you may trim your video.</p>
<p>The sad part is that the pre-installed video editor for Windows is just like the one for Mac. It is slow to process, it is very basic, and it doesn’t allow you to edit frame-by-frame. As a result, most people prefer a free online video trimmer as opposed to a pre-installed tool or third-party video trimmer app.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3"><a href="#10-Best-Free-Online-Video-Trimmers-3" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers"></a>10+ Best Free Online Video Trimmers</h2><p>There are many reasons why online trimmers are preferred. Many times, the sorts of video trimmers one downloads are full of malware, bloatware, and ransomware. Even the ones that claim to be clean have suspicious obvious security holes.</p>
<p>Another common reason is that many online trimmers allow trimming and conversions in formats, file types, and resolutions that downloadable programs do not. Also, even the world’s best free downloadable video trimmer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, is so viciously complicated that one would need weeks of tutorials just to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>In many cases, the simplest and most straight-forwards answer is to use an online trimmer. To quickly upload, trim, convert, maybe add effects, and then download. It is quicker, easier, and often runs a smaller risk of security breaches, ID theft, and malware problems.</p>
<p>So in this part, I review the 10+ best online video trimmers that are easy to use for beginners and those who just need a few of cuts. Among them on the top is video cutter from Wondershare.</p>
<h4 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora-Online-Video-Trimmer-3"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora-Online-Video-Trimmer-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>The WonderShare Filmora program is littered with features you can use if you are willing to download its program and use it on your device. It has a free version that you can download, but what most people do not know is that it has a video trimmer online.</p>
<p>The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video trimmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows you to upload a video, and then edit it within your web browser. Once your video is uploaded, you are able to edit and trim it in minutes. You may also change the output format. You may set the video trim using the manual tool that allows you to look at your video as it plays. Or, you may use the start and end function and simply enter the starting position and finishing position.</p>
<p>Exporting and downloading is very easy, and there is no obligation to buy one of their other tools. The odd thing is that most people do not know this service is even available. Most people think that the website is simply full of editing tools. Most are unaware there are any free online tools.</p>
<p>Just like many users known, Wondershare has a desktop video editor for Windows and Mac that is very easy and simple to use, named <strong>Filmora</strong>. it’s very powerful for beginners. You can download it for free now.</p>

<p>The name may be a little uninspired, but the video cutter is not a bad online tool. It is nestled in between a series of other simple online tools such as a voice recorder, file converter and so forth. You do not need to download this tool. You start by clicking the “Open File” button.</p>
<p>Pick the video you wish to trim, and then wait for it to upload. It takes a while to upload your video because the servers are not great. Once the video is uploaded, you are able to use the simple tools the website has to offer in order to trim your video.</p>
<p>There is a bit of advertising on the website, but mostly the web master is hoping for donations to keep the website running. Since the website doesn’t make much money, it cannot afford to pay for better bandwidth or better servers, which is why it sometimes takes quite a while to upload, trim, and then download. But, it is free, so it is difficult to complain.</p>
<h4 id="4-YouTube-Creator-Studio-3"><a href="#4-YouTube-Creator-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="4. YouTube Creator Studio"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/creators/" >YouTube Creator Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the YouTube video trimmer tools are pretty poor quality. But, they ride high on this list because of their amazing server speeds and storage capacity. There are plenty of video editors that will cut out if you try to upload larger files, but the YouTube Creator Studio will not.</p>
<p>YouTube has billions of dollars behind it because it is owned by Google. A common problem with online video trimmers is that they take too long to upload and download. That is still a problem with the YouTube system, but it is still one of the fastest uploading and downloading video tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Another problem with other online trimmers is that it is difficult to upload large videos. Many online trimmers will freeze or crash, which means all the uploading was for nothing. But, the YouTube system will not crash or freeze. You simply leave your computer alone, and eventually it will upload your file (even large files). For these reasons, the YouTube Creator Studios tool rides pretty high up this list.</p>
<h4 id="5-Video-Toolbox-3"><a href="#5-Video-Toolbox-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Toolbox"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.videotoolbox.com/" >Video Toolbox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>The Video Toolbox system sits on a very cheaply made website that is pretty darn ugly. But, this tool reaches the number four position because it is rather more advanced than one has come to expect from a free video trimmer and editor.</p>
<p>The tool is free, and it can process video files of up to 1500MB, which is not a massive amount, but it is about the size of three episodes of the Simpsons. This tool can convert your video files to a wide range of other file types. You may also alter the bit rate, audio codec, video codex, frame rate, sample rate and channels.</p>
<p>This tool also comes with online features that allow you to re-download your previous videos, see your recent file outputs, and delete your log files. It is also able to pull items from your videos such as meta data, subtitle files, and so forth. Plus, the tool allows you to merge videos and crop videos with just a few clicks.</p>

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>The WeVideo tool is an online editor. It is a video trimmer windows compatible program that will run off of your Edge web browser. The tool is pretty easy to use, it is fairly fast and flexible. The sad part is that this tool offers a series of seemingly perfect tool functions, but it asks for money for them.</p>
<p>For example, the video trimmer is free, but the green-screen tool is not. They always ask you to turn your free account into a paid account, which is very annoying. Yet, this tool reaches number five on this list because the GUI for the video trimmer is great, and the level of support for this system is pretty good too.</p>
<h4 id="7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter-3"><a href="#7-Wincreator-Video-Cutter-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Wincreator Video Cutter"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.wincreator.com/video-cutter" >Wincreator Video Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="free online video trimmer"
                ></p>
<p>This video editor is another video trimmer free service. The GUI is pretty ugly, but it is the sort of simple tool that gets to the point and gets there pretty quickly. The biggest downside is that the free video trimmer will only accept up to 50MB of data. This is not very much. It is the sort of amount you may upload to Instagram.</p>
<p>The tool is very lightweight, which means the pages are less likely to crash or freeze. It also means that the editor loads quickly and doesn’t lag as you use it. If other editors were this simple, then far fewer people would feel the need to download video trimming software.</p>
<h4 id="8-Kizoa-7"><a href="#8-Kizoa-7" class="headerlink" title="8. Kizoa"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kizoa.com/Video-Editor" >Kizoa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a fully featured multi-faceted tool for editing videos. It offers a great deal of functions that allow you to trim your videos and edit them in a variety of ways. The sad part is that this tool is very well presented on the website, but most of the tools are locked behind a paywall. They nag users to pay their one-time fee, or to join their premium membership.</p>
<p>If you are looking to trim your videos, then this is a good place for uploading and trimming 4K videos. It also allows you to share videos, and if you pay, then you can store RAW videos. The online movie editor and movie maker allow you to trim your videos frame-by-frame. This is perfect for people who need precision when they are trimming their videos. It is also the sort of tool that more advanced users may enjoy.</p>
<h4 id="9-Aconvert-Video-Cutter-3"><a href="#9-Aconvert-Video-Cutter-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Aconvert Video Cutter"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.aconvert.com/video/split/" >Aconvert Video Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>This is possibly one of the simplest tools on this list, which is good in most cases, but some may need a little more in order to do a good job. There is however a function that offers a little more flexibility than other tools. Once your video is uploaded, you can choose a different output file from over ten different file types.</p>
<p>You can specify which part of the video you wish to cut prior to uploading. This saves a lot of processing time when the video is uploaded, which is probably going to suit people who have a lot of small videos to cut and who do not want to wait around for the website to respond. You are able to upload up to 200MB, which is not great, but it is also not terrible. It is around the size of four music videos, or a mobile-episode of a US sitcom.</p>
