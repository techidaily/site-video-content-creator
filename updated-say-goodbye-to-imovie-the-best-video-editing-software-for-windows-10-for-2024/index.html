<p>It has been some time since Microsoft stopped all support for Windows 7, which left PC users without the<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iMovie equivalent Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Moreover, Windows 10 doesn’t have a built-in app that is dedicated solely to video editing.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn’t panic if you are looking for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing software for Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since there are plenty of free and affordable options to choose from. In fact, finding an app you can use to polish your videos on PC computers, shouldn’t be too difficult even if you have no previous video editing experience.</p>
<p>That is why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best iMovie replacements for Windows 10 you can use to create stunning videos that are going to attract the attention of your online audience.</p>
<h2 id="Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid"><a href="#Top-5-iMovie-Replacements-for-Windows-10-Free-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]"></a>Top 5 iMovie Replacements for Windows 10 [Free &amp; Paid]</h2><p>iMovie isn’t designed to perform demanding video editing tasks, which is the reason why we selected the video editing software products that are aimed at newcomers to the video editing world. So let’s take a look at some of the best video editing apps for Windows 10 you can use as a replacement for iMovie.</p>
<h3 id="1-Windows-10-Photos-App"><a href="#1-Windows-10-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Windows 10 Photos App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" >Windows 10 Photos App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Photos app is the only built-in app on Windows 10 that offers video editing features. Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

Even though the app is designed to help PC users view, organize and edit photos, you can still use it to perform basic video editing tasks.</p>
<p>You can either choose to start working on a new project from scratch or to create a video automatically. In case you decide to make a video automatically, you just have to select the footage, name your project and wait for the Photos App to generate a new video for you.</p>
<p>Opting to edit your footage manually will enable you to trim or split video clips, alter their playback speed and apply filters to the footage. Optionally, you can also add text layers to your videos, use motion effects to simulate camera movement, or use some available 3D filters. Exporting projects in resolutions higher than 1080p or uploading your videos directly to social media from the Photos app isn’t an option.</p>

One can just drag the level line and move it up or down for adjusting the dB of any given clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The job of the tiny white points on the right and left side of the clip is to apply the fade in and fade out effect on the audio. The left sided point can be dragged to the right to mark the ending of the fade-in effect of the clip. The right point has to be dragged left to set the start of the fade-out point.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this level, any effects and adjustments in audio are applicable for the entire clip including the audio channels within it. All the adjustments in the individual audio channels made by you would be preserved by FCP. This implies that when one reduces the volume for just one channel but increases the volume of the entire clip, then the single channel’s volume is only raised in proportion to the volume of the other channels. Ideally, you should do your edits at the clip-level when you have only one or two audio channels on your video clip.</p>
<h4 id="Section-2-Advanced-Audio-Editing"><a href="#Section-2-Advanced-Audio-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Advanced Audio Editing"></a>Section 2: Advanced Audio Editing</h4><p>The audio of the video can be detached for editing the audio file separately. The Audio Inspector of FCP provides you with all precise controls of audio edit like pan, effect, volume, equalization and audio configuration.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" The Audio Inspector "
                ></p>
<p>In order to detach the audio, you need to go to <strong>Clip</strong> &gt; <strong>Detach Audio</strong>. Or you can just right-click on the video file and click on Detach audio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" Detach audio "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a fine difference between ‘Detach Audio’ and ‘Expand Audio’. In Expand Audio, the audio clip is synced with the video. For instance, while moving the audio to the timeline, the video clip would also go with it. In case of detaching audio however the audio file would remain as a standalone clip that can be inserted into any portion of the video.</p>
<p>The Audio Inspector would allow you to apply the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The volume can be increased by dragging the handle on the right side and lowered by dragging it towards the left.</li>
<li>Audio Equalization would allow the user to apply various effects (bass, loudness, boost, etc.) on the audio clip. It can also be adjusted by using the in-built audio equalizer.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Pan- Users can select from a number of Pan modes like surround sound or stereo. When you select ‘surround’, Final Cut Pro would provide you with a <strong>Surround Panner</strong> which would allow you to fine-tune the effects by moving the white point.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Effects- for this option one needs to go to the effects browser of the <strong>Audio Inspector</strong> or just hit comd5. This would allow you to choose many different audio effects such as echo, distortion, spaces and much more. Just double-click on any effect to find a range of editing options.</li>

The left sided point can be dragged to the right to mark the ending of the fade-in effect of the clip. The right point has to be dragged left to set the start of the fade-out point.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this level, any effects and adjustments in audio are applicable for the entire clip including the audio channels within it. All the adjustments in the individual audio channels made by you would be preserved by FCP. This implies that when one reduces the volume for just one channel but increases the volume of the entire clip, then the single channel’s volume is only raised in proportion to the volume of the other channels. Ideally, you should do your edits at the clip-level when you have only one or two audio channels on your video clip.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a fine difference between ‘Detach Audio’ and ‘Expand Audio’. In Expand Audio, the audio clip is synced with the video. For instance, while moving the audio to the timeline, the video clip would also go with it. In case of detaching audio however the audio file would remain as a standalone clip that can be inserted into any portion of the video.</p>
<p>The Audio Inspector would allow you to apply the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The volume can be increased by dragging the handle on the right side and lowered by dragging it towards the left.</li>
<li>Audio Equalization would allow the user to apply various effects (bass, loudness, boost, etc.) on the audio clip. It can also be adjusted by using the in-built audio equalizer.</li>

<p> Adobe have recently released their new multi-platform video editing tool named <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html" >Adobe Rush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p> Dubbed the video editing tool for the YouTube generation, having been designed from the ground up for online video creators. Editing is simple via its suite of audio and visual tools, including title screens, transition effects and color adjustment tools. Export is optimized for all social platforms available, including Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.</p>
<p> Despite the promise of the perfect video editing tool, it’s not been entirely warmly received. Some complain that the editing tools are just too basic, others that the price is uncompetitive. Other issues have been raised with slow rendering capabilities and general instability of the platform, causing crashes that can set projects back by hours.</p>
<p> We’re going to take a look at some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush out there, which may be more capable of getting the job done.</p>

<p> Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You’ll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.</p>
<p> Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.</p>
<p> An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you’ll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you’re an Android user, you’ll need to wait to experience the ‘Rush’, because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.</p>
<h4 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><p> As a video editing tool, it’s fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it’s somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you’re into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.</p>
<p> In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p> What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you’re going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It’s great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it’s really nothing special.</p>
<h4 id="Price"><a href="#Price" class="headerlink" title="Price"></a>Price</h4><p> If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.</p>
<h2 id="Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms"></a>Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms</h2><p> While Adobe are marketing Rush as a ‘cross platform’ video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.</p>

Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://effects.wondershare.com/" >300 high performance effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and filters to perfect your visual appeal.</p>

<p> Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don’t need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.</p>
<p><strong>2. For Mac - iMovie</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful editing tool designed for iOS and perfect to use on a Mac. Using your own photos and videos, you can create polished movies complete with titles and even a credits roll. It’s great for turning memories into beautiful keepsakes, which can then be shared with family and friends via social media or direct from your Apple device.</p>

<p> The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.</p>
<p> iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.</p>
<p><strong>3. For Android - Filmora</strong></p>
<p> As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you’ll come across and with all the features you need to get started.</p>
<p> Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.</p>
<p> For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It’s free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.</p>
<p><strong>4. For iOS - LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumafusion/id1062022008?mt=8" >LumaFusion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful multi track video editor which has been built for the mobile marketplace.

                ></p>
<p> It’s not the easiest app to get started with, but the creators have made a ton of tutorial videos to help you get to grips with it. Capability wise, it’s amazing, with up to three tracks for photos, videos, graphic and titles as well as an additional three audio tracks for narration, music and sound effects.</p>
<p> Video editing includes a wealth of special effects, from color correction tools to transitions, as well as an audio track mixer which can be adjusted on the fly. Title pages can be created, as well as adapting the speed and ratio of playback. Sharing the finished project can be done via social media, cloud storage, disk storage and more.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p> It’s great to see more software like Adobe Rush coming onto the market; however, it’s important to realize that, despite the hype, there may still be drawbacks to some of these systems. For us, Adobe Rush was exactly that something for editing videos in a rush. If you’re serious about making awesome clips though, investigating some of these alternatives to Adobe Rush.</p>
<p> Before you shell out the high subscription price for Adobe products, it’s worth considering what you really want from your software. Having some goals in mind will allow you to compare the different alternatives to Premier Rush to see where the best value for money lies.</p>

<p> Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You’ll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.</p>
<p> Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.</p>
<p> An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you’ll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you’re an Android user, you’ll need to wait to experience the ‘Rush’, because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.</p>
<h4 id="Performance-1"><a href="#Performance-1" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><p> As a video editing tool, it’s fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it’s somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you’re into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.</p>
<p> In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p> What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you’re going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It’s great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it’s really nothing special.</p>
<h4 id="Price-1"><a href="#Price-1" class="headerlink" title="Price"></a>Price</h4><p> If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals.

Unlike Rush, you can pick and choose your video output format, as Filmora is compatible with all major video file types including mp4, FLV, MKV, AVI, MOV and more. Instead of being limited to a handful of basic effects, Filmora supports more than <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://effects.wondershare.com/" >300 high performance effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and filters to perfect your visual appeal.</p>

<p> As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There’re no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.</p>

<p> As well as being a video editor, Filmora is a working audio editor too, featuring a full mixer and equalizer to bring your music and speech to life. There’re no transitional limitations, and you can even use green-screen technology, tilt-shift and jump cut features to make your videos pop.</p>

<p> Each video can use up to 99 timelines to make it easier to edit and customize your work. Finally, and a big plus for many of us, you don’t need to have the latest and best PC in order to use this software. Wondershare Filmora works on Windows 7, 8 and 10, and requires only 3GB of RAM. If you want to work in HD or 4K quality, however, you will need 8GB RAM.</p>

<p> The user-friendly interface makes it possible for even the most novice of users to harness the power of digital video editing. Complete with templates and easy to use tools, even beginners can make high quality trailers, logos and cinema like productions.</p>
<p> iMovie lets users access a number of special effects and enhancements, as well as ten filters to improve the images. Music can be chosen from their own library, and narrative voice overs are possible too. We think iMovie is one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush available for Mac.</p>
<p><strong>3. For Android - Filmora</strong></p>
<p> As Rush is not yet available for the Android platform, users must look for alternatives to Premier Rush if they want to go ahead and start making movies. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great solution, as powerful as most of the desktop editors you’ll come across and with all the features you need to get started.</p>
<p> Clips can be selected from your own device, or from Facebook or Google, and then added into your project folder to be created into a movie. They can then be arranged into a handy timeline, using simple drag and drop functionality which is easy for even beginners to master. There are even in-built themes which you can try out to turn your home movies into something special.</p>
<p> For switching between stills or video clips, there are a raft of fun transitions available to make it a more cohesive production. You can adjust colors, brightness, speed and more, as well as adding in subtitles and editing in music. One of the best features of this software is the picture-in-picture function, where you can add another video or still over the main one. It’s free and amazing fun, and we think one of the best alternatives to Adobe Rush for Android.</p>
<p><strong>4. For iOS - LumaFusion</strong></p>

<p> It’s not the easiest app to get started with, but the creators have made a ton of tutorial videos to help you get to grips with it. Capability wise, it’s amazing, with up to three tracks for photos, videos, graphic and titles as well as an additional three audio tracks for narration, music and sound effects.</p>
<p> Video editing includes a wealth of special effects, from color correction tools to transitions, as well as an audio track mixer which can be adjusted on the fly. Title pages can be created, as well as adapting the speed and ratio of playback. Sharing the finished project can be done via social media, cloud storage, disk storage and more.</p>

For us, Adobe Rush was exactly that something for editing videos in a rush. If you’re serious about making awesome clips though, investigating some of these alternatives to Adobe Rush.</p>
<p> Before you shell out the high subscription price for Adobe products, it’s worth considering what you really want from your software. Having some goals in mind will allow you to compare the different alternatives to Premier Rush to see where the best value for money lies.</p>

<p> Adobe have recently released their new multi-platform video editing tool named <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html" >Adobe Rush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p> Dubbed the video editing tool for the YouTube generation, having been designed from the ground up for online video creators. Editing is simple via its suite of audio and visual tools, including title screens, transition effects and color adjustment tools. Export is optimized for all social platforms available, including Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.</p>
<p> Despite the promise of the perfect video editing tool, it’s not been entirely warmly received. Some complain that the editing tools are just too basic, others that the price is uncompetitive. Other issues have been raised with slow rendering capabilities and general instability of the platform, causing crashes that can set projects back by hours.</p>
<p> We’re going to take a look at some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush out there, which may be more capable of getting the job done.</p>

<p> Windows users will need to be upgraded to the latest version of the operating system, at least version 1709 as a minimum. You’ll also need at least 8GB of RAM if you want to avoid the system crashing every time you use it.</p>
<p> Despite having computers that meet the required spec, numerous users have complained that Adobe Rush is buggy and repeatedly crashes. Some say that the laggy performance makes it almost impossible to use.</p>
<p> An alternative is to use Rush on your iPhone, but for this you’ll need to own at least an iPhone 7, preferably something newer. In testing, we found it to be very slow, even on an iPhone X. If you’re an Android user, you’ll need to wait to experience the ‘Rush’, because this software is not available for your handset yet. Adobe have said they are working on it and how to have it ready at some point in 2019.</p>
<h4 id="Performance-3"><a href="#Performance-3" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h4><p> As a video editing tool, it’s fairly competent, but for anything more than the basics, it’s somewhat lacking. Many of the most basic video editing tools are missing, and the platform supports only three transitions, so if you’re into making longer or more complex videos, its just not going to work.</p>
<p> In terms of rendering, we found it incredibly slow in comparison to some of the alternatives to Adobe Rush. The background music choices are pretty limited too, and most of it is not what you want accompanying your cutting-edge videos.</p>
<p> What really broke the deal for us was the inability to specify the output of your video files. This means that although social sharing could be OK, you’re going to be stuck if you want to share it in other locations. It’s great to see a video editing app on iPhone, but overall, it’s really nothing special.</p>
<h4 id="Price-3"><a href="#Price-3" class="headerlink" title="Price"></a>Price</h4><p> If you already subscribe to the Adobe Create Cloud (CC) suite, then Rush will be included in your subscription. However, if you want to subscribe to it as a standalone app, the price is $9.99 a month for individuals. This is not particularly competitive with the alternatives to Premier Rush, and could be prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist, which is, after all, the market Adobe are aiming at.</p>
<h2 id="Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms-3"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Adobe-Rush-for-All-Platforms-3" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms"></a>Alternatives to Adobe Rush for All Platforms</h2><p> While Adobe are marketing Rush as a ‘cross platform’ video editor, there are alternatives to Premier Rush which do the job just as well, if not better, and often for a lot less.</p>
