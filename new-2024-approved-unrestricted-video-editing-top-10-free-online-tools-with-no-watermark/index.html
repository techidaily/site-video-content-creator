<h2 id="Part-1-What-to-Consider-When-Choosing-an-Online-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-1-What-to-Consider-When-Choosing-an-Online-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor"></a>Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor</h2><p>Each video editor listed below has its distinct features. Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.</p>
<h4 id="1-Pricing"><a href="#1-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="1. Pricing"></a>1. Pricing</h4><p>Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99&#x2F;month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99&#x2F;month if you have to?</p>
<p>It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.</p>
<h4 id="2-Features"><a href="#2-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. Features"></a>2. Features</h4><p>The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.</p>
<p>Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.</p>
<h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p>Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don’t have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.</p>
<p>Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.</p>
<h4 id="4-Purpose-of-the-Video"><a href="#4-Purpose-of-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Purpose of the Video"></a>4. Purpose of the Video</h4><p>Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.</p>
<p>Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-to-Consider-When-Choosing-an-Online-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-to-Consider-When-Choosing-an-Online-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor"></a>Part 1: What to Consider When Choosing an Online Video Editor</h2><p>Each video editor listed below has its distinct features. Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.</p>
<h4 id="1-Pricing-1"><a href="#1-Pricing-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Pricing"></a>1. Pricing</h4><p>Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99&#x2F;month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99&#x2F;month if you have to?</p>
<p>It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.</p>
<h4 id="2-Features-1"><a href="#2-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Features"></a>2. Features</h4><p>The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.</p>
<p>Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.</p>
<h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use-1"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p>Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don’t have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.</p>
<p>Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.</p>
<h4 id="4-Purpose-of-the-Video-1"><a href="#4-Purpose-of-the-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Purpose of the Video"></a>4. Purpose of the Video</h4><p>Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.</p>
<p>Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.</p>

Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.</p>
<h4 id="1-Pricing-2"><a href="#1-Pricing-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Pricing"></a>1. Pricing</h4><p>Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99&#x2F;month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99&#x2F;month if you have to?</p>
<p>It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.</p>
<h4 id="2-Features-2"><a href="#2-Features-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Features"></a>2. Features</h4><p>The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.</p>
<p>Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.</p>
<h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use-2"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p>Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don’t have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.</p>
<p>Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.</p>
<h4 id="4-Purpose-of-the-Video-2"><a href="#4-Purpose-of-the-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Purpose of the Video"></a>4. Purpose of the Video</h4><p>Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.</p>
<p>Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.</p>

Here are the factors to consider when choosing an online video editor.</p>
<h4 id="1-Pricing-3"><a href="#1-Pricing-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Pricing"></a>1. Pricing</h4><p>Whereas some online video editors are absolutely free, to others payment is a must to access no watermark option. It may be financially draining to subscribe to a $49.99&#x2F;month plan. Then, why not opt for the $9.99&#x2F;month if you have to?</p>
<p>It’s critically important to weigh your financial strengths. However, the features included in the paid plans and the video purpose determine how much to spend.</p>
<h4 id="2-Features-3"><a href="#2-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Features"></a>2. Features</h4><p>The attractiveness and video theme are better actualized by the features you use. Can you spot “no watermark” indicated anywhere within the features? Whether your edited videos will show with editor labels or watermarks is determined by the online video editor’s features.</p>
<p>Choosing an online video editor with cloud-based storage full of royalty-free videos and templates helps save time and simplifies editing procedures.</p>
<h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use-3"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p>Some online video editors are so complex that you’ve to tutorials and guides before starting to edit. You don’t have to spend 2 hours editing a 10-minute video.</p>
<p>Before you can begin to use any video editor, consider evaluating the complexity of all features to use. How to import images and share edited videos to social media and websites should be given first priority during the evaluation process.</p>
<h4 id="4-Purpose-of-the-Video-3"><a href="#4-Purpose-of-the-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Purpose of the Video"></a>4. Purpose of the Video</h4><p>Creating and editing commercial videos require an online video editor with features designed with a business theme. You cannot choose an editor with watermarks and yet you are advertising a different product.</p>
<p>Tutorial videos are usually above 8 minutes and the voice should be as clear as possible. Some video editors and plans are limited to a 5-minute video.</p>

<p>Before we take the plunge to understand how we can prevent getting into trouble with the Final Cut Pro X in the first place, let’s explore when this tool needs to be reset. Here are a few reasons to reset Final Cut Pro X:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin malfunction:</strong> When the plugin i.e. the feature or effect for the video, is not in working condition, any user cannot edit the video as per their wish.</li>
<li><strong>Black screen while playing video:</strong> During the video editing process, users can experience a black screen on the preview, but the timeline may display the video. This can waste their hours of video editing efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Crashing FCPX:</strong> Oftentimes, the latest version of Final Cut Pro X can keep crashing because of the corrupted preferences. When users do not reset the preferences, it can corrupt the file and crash the video editor.</li>
<li><strong>Crashing Timeline:</strong> This can happen when the timeline does not render or&#x2F;and share due to which it can crash during playback of the rendered area.</li>
<li><strong>Troubling Library:</strong> The library may not open due to which even the event icon can be missing, and it may affect to share the project and render timelines that call for resetting.</li>
<li><strong>Odd Editing Operations:</strong> One can face strange editing operations and may not be able to share the project timeline and even render.</li>
<li><strong>A problem in Importing:</strong> When users cannot render or export project timeline, they may not be able to import the footage which would require resetting.</li>

<h2 id="How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?"></a>How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be really exciting to use if you also get to know the solutions to reset the video editing tool. There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences"><a href="#Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Locating the Preferences"></a>Method 1: Locating the Preferences</h3><p>You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.</p>
<p>The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files"><a href="#Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Deleting Render Files"></a>Method 2: Deleting Render Files</h3><p>Do remember to save your important files before you do this. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.</p>
<p>You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder"><a href="#Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder"></a>Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder</h3><p>This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Word"><a href="#Final-Word" class="headerlink" title="Final Word"></a>Final Word</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3"><a href="#How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?"></a>How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be really exciting to use if you also get to know the solutions to reset the video editing tool. There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences-3"><a href="#Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Locating the Preferences"></a>Method 1: Locating the Preferences</h3><p>You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.</p>
<p>The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files-3"><a href="#Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Deleting Render Files"></a>Method 2: Deleting Render Files</h3><p>Do remember to save your important files before you do this. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.</p>
<p>You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder-3"><a href="#Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder"></a>Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder</h3><p>This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Word-3"><a href="#Final-Word-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Word"></a>Final Word</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.</p>

Because it is online and operates straight in the browser, you may use it to adjust the brightness of your Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p>All you have to do now is upload the video from your computer that you wish to modify. You may upload up to 500 MBs in the free version.

<p>Filmora video editor allows you to adjust the brightness with the auto enhance feature in one-click. What’s more, it provides the color match feature which allows you to match the color between different clips.</p>
<h3 id="2-VSDC-Free-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#2-VSDC-Free-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="2. VSDC Free Video Editor"></a><strong>2.</strong> VSDC Free Video Editor</h3><p>The VSDC Free Footage Editor, in the hands of a skilled user, can generate some truly professional-looking videos. The application supports virtually all major video formats and includes complex video effects such as object transformation and color correction, and also advanced audio effects such as volume adjustment and sound normalization. You have the luxury of brightening your videos simply by uploading the video from your desktop and making whatever changes that you want to make.</p>
<p>VSDC Free Video Editor is actually free, unlike certain “high-end” editors. You may utilize the whole feature set of the application without having to contend with annoying watermarks. Unfortunately, there is one snag. You must pay if you want technical assistance. (And there’s a strong possibility you’ll have to.) Subscription for the VSDC Free Video Editor is $1 per month, $5 per half-year, and $10 per year.</p>
<h3 id="3-iMovie-3"><a href="#3-iMovie-3" class="headerlink" title="3. iMovie"></a><strong>3.</strong> iMovie</h3><p>iMovie for Mac allows you to experience your films in new ways. Make Hollywood-style teasers and gorgeous movies in excellent 4K resolution by quickly browsing your footage and instantly sharing your best moments. Color Balance and Color Correction are two options for brightening a movie in iMovie 10.1 or later. The former has four tabs: Auto, Match Color, White Balance, and Skin Tone Balance, which allow you to make automated color adjustments.</p>
<p>The latter has sliders for manually adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, shadows, and other parameters. Simply choose the clip you want to change and then select the appropriate tool from the toolbar above the viewer. It’s not very technical, but it makes it simple to brighten up a gloomy video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Premiere-Pro-CC-3"><a href="#4-Premiere-Pro-CC-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Premiere Pro CC"></a>4. <strong>Premiere</strong> Pro CC</h3><p>Premiere Pro includes a user interface that is both appealing and versatile. The startup feature enables you to rapidly return to previous projects, start new ones, or browse for Adobe Stock video. You can switch between workspaces for Assembly, Editing, Color, Effects, Audio, and Titles, and the dark system window tends to make your videos the focus of attention.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro CC is another desktop video editor that you can use to brighten your videos. The various parameters in the Lumetri Color panel window inside Premiere Pro CC may be used to accomplish video color correction.</p>
<p>Premiere Pro’s Lumetri Color Tools elevate the application to the level of Photoshop for video. These tools provide a surprising amount of color modification and a wide range of film and HDR effects. With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.</p>
<h3 id="5-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#5-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Final Cut Pro"></a>5. Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect’s settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.</p>
<p>Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Adjusting brightness has become a “small problem” for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria – it’s too dark! However, when you have quality <strong>Video Brightness Editors</strong>, like the ones we have reviewed above, you’re in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.</p>
