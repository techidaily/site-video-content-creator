<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Best-Free-DVD-Players-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10"></a>Best Free DVD Players for Windows 10</h2><p>Before you opt for one DVD player or the other you must first check which audio and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video file formats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> they support or find out if you can use them to play Blu-ray discs. You should also check a player’s compatibility with the operating system you have installed on your computer and that you have all the codecs necessary to play ISO and other image, audio and video file format. So let’s take a look at ten best free DVD players for Windows 10.</p>
<h3 id="1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan"><a href="#1-VLC-Media-Player-by-VideoLan" class="headerlink" title="1. VLC Media Player by VideoLan"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.videolan.org/" >VLC Media Player by VideoLan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Over the course of the last two decades, VLC has established itself as one of the most versatile media players ever created.

<p>What’s more, playing a DVD or a Blu-ray with VLC is a simple task you can complete in just a few clicks. The Open Disc option that is located in the player’s Media menu enables you to choose if you would like to open a DVD, VCD, Audio CD or Blu-ray disc.

<p>VirtualDub is a free video capture&#x2F;processing tool for Windows platforms (2000&#x2F;XP&#x2F;Vista&#x2F;7). And VirtualDub MPEG-2 is a modified version of VirtualDub that supports MPEG-2 import originally. However, just as the author said “This software is obsolete and will no longer be updated. For MPEG-2 and WMV support in the latest VirtualDub, try my plugins (MPEG-2 plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 or above - by editor)”.</p>
<h2 id="Download-and-Install-VirtualDub-MPEG-2-3"><a href="#Download-and-Install-VirtualDub-MPEG-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Download and Install VirtualDub MPEG-2"></a>Download and Install VirtualDub MPEG-2</h2><p>You could <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.videohelp.com/download/VirtualDub-MPEG224586%20.zip?r=LcPXQgGCmNps" >download VirtualDub MPEG-2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here and extract files to a folder. Now you get a video processing software with MPEG-2 video import supported. To run VirtualDub MPEG-2, double click the VirtualDub.exe.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Use-VirtualDub-MPEG-2-to-Compress-Large-MPEG-2-Videos-3"><a href="#How-to-Use-VirtualDub-MPEG-2-to-Compress-Large-MPEG-2-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Use VirtualDub MPEG-2 to Compress Large MPEG-2 Videos"></a>How to Use VirtualDub MPEG-2 to Compress Large MPEG-2 Videos</h2><p>VirtualDub-MPEG2 is designed to work with mpeg2 video, such as Digital TV shows, un-encrypted DVD files (*.vob) and these video files are usually in big size. Now you can compress them using VirtualDub MPEG-2.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Set-Up-Video-Compression-3"><a href="#Step-1-Set-Up-Video-Compression-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Set Up Video Compression"></a>Step 1: Set Up Video Compression</h3><p>Open your MPEG-2 video file through File&#x2F;Open video file…, then go to Video&#x2F;Compression to bring up the following dialog.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="virtualdub mpeg2"
                ></p>
<p>As shown above, select the XVID MPEG-4 codec and click Configure button to make Xvid settings.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="virtualdub mepg2 tutorial"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If Compression is disable, switch to Full processing mode first in the Video menu.</p>
<h3 id="Step-2-Set-Up-Audio-Compression-3"><a href="#Step-2-Set-Up-Audio-Compression-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Set Up Audio Compression"></a>Step 2: Set Up Audio Compression</h3><p>Audio compression setup is similar to video compression, go to Audio&#x2F;Full processing mode, and again Audio&#x2F;Compression to open the dialog, where MPEG Layer-3 is recommended.</p>
<h3 id="Step-3-Start-Compressing-3"><a href="#Step-3-Start-Compressing-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Start Compressing"></a>Step 3: Start Compressing</h3><p>Now it’s the time to start processing your video, here is how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the File Menu</li>
<li>Select Save as AVI…</li>
<li>Select where you want to save the AVI and name it.</li>
<li>Click Save.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The VirtualDub MPEG-2 needs some time to compress your video. The larger the video file is, the longer. But VirtualDub MPEG2 is a fast video processing software. Take a cup of coffee and relax. Once finished, use your favorite video player to see the compressing result.</p>
