<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>

<p>However, as with any good program, third-party plugins could only help you take your work to the next level by adding new features or streamlining your process.</p>
<p>It should be unsurprising that After Effects has many plugins for a program that is over 30 years old. Here are the best stabilization plugins for smoother video in AE:</p>

<p>You would believe that making planets in 3D is simple —create a circle, add textures, and you’re done! Getting a world to ‘look’ properly, on the other hand, might be more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>For example, how can the line between night and day be altered in a model of a populated planet such that cities may be visible at night but not during the day?</p>
<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool. This is particularly true when used in conjunction with other After Effects plugins or paired with a 3D lens from a 3D program, which may be brought into After Effects with background plates for things like spacecraft.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you’ve identified <strong>Warp Stabilizer</strong>, you’ll have to add it to the layer you want to stabilize. You may accomplish this in one of three different ways. You may either drag and drop the filter into the chosen layer in the composing window, place it on the desired layer in the timeline, or double-tap on the effect while selecting your choice footage layer.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you apply the warp stabilizer, it will start immediately. So now, all you have to do is lay back and let the stabilizer do its job.</p>
<p>(Note: The procedure should take no more than a few minutes, and a blue bar will appear across your composition window, indicating that the warp stabilizer is evaluating the film. The composition panel would then display an orange bar, indicating that the effect is applied).</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After stabilization, use the spacebar to begin a RAM peek. Choose the layer you added to and click to display the drop-down menu or go to the Effects Control panel whenever you need to tweak the stabilizing effect.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The tracker panel is most likely open by default in your edition of After Effects, but if it isn’t, go to <strong>Window</strong> in the top menu to open it.

<p>Although Orb doesn’t work for every planetary picture, this would function for 90% of them and is a helpful previs tool.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Shaky video footage would be the last thing any video creator wants unless it’s done intentionally for artistic or creative reasons. As a result, they employ methods and equipment to keep the camera safe from any undesired movement.</p>
<p>However, occasionally those tools aren’t available, and the outcome is questionable. That is why we decided to compile this article to add to the knowledge of our readers how they can use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize videos</strong> to enhance their video content!</p>

<p>Video content is becoming increasingly popular; with the proliferation of online content, practically every product now needs its mini-documentary or video clip. Experienced filmmakers and VFX artists used to be the only ones who could get smooth footage. Those days, however, are over.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an excellent tool for smoothing out video footage, in addition to being a great blending and motion animation software; although it’s usually preferable to maintain your film as seamless as possible on location, it’s not the end of the world if you take a seat to edit your video and decide it’s too shaky. In truth, there are several options available to you. In After Effects, there are three options for stabilizing footage. What are they – and how to use <strong>After Effects to</strong> <strong>stabilize footage</strong>? Let’s find out!</p>

In this part, I will show you how to apply Warp Stabilizer to a layer, adjust the effect’s essential parameters, and demonstrate how they work briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The Warp Stabilizer is the most excellent built-in choice for After Effects. This may be found under the Distort tools section of the Effects &amp; Presets panel. You may also go to the effects tab and look for “<strong>Warp</strong>“ in the search box.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe’s Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="7. Apple Final Cut Pro X"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/" >Apple Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="8. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/" >MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor"><a href="#2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?"></a>2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?</h4><p>If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.</p>
<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>

It features an interface that has been created for ease of use, but there is also the option to select between Expert or Quick editing modes, depending upon your skill level and needs.</p>

<p>Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to <strong>3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)</strong> based on your need.</p>

You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-1"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-1" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-1"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-1"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe’s Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-1"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Apple Final Cut Pro X"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/" >Apple Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-1"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-1" class="headerlink" title="8. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/" >MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-1"><a href="#2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-1" class="headerlink" title="2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?"></a>2.

<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>

<p>Filmora features the ability to import and edit 4K videos with ease. After launching Filmora, create a new project by clicking New Project in the Get Started window and then go to Project Settings to change the resolution to <strong>3840 x 2160 (16:9 4K UHD)</strong> or <strong>4096 x 2160 (DCI 4K)</strong> based on your need.</p>

<p>The default project setting is 1920 x 1080 (16:9 Full HD), if you didn’t set up the project settings at the beginning, Filmora will prompt up a window asking you to change the project settings to match the 4K video.

<h4 id="2-iMovie-2"><a href="#2-iMovie-2" class="headerlink" title="2. iMovie"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you are a Mac user and have iMovie 10.1 or version above, you can now edit 4K videos on your Mac with iMovie for free. iMovie is a free 4K video editing software for Mac. You can also import movies and trailers from iMovie for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" iMovie Project Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>With iMovie for iOS and macOS, you can enjoy your videos like never before. It’s easy to browse your clips and create Hollywood-style trailers and stunning 4K-resolution movies. You can even start editing on iPhone or iPad, then finish on your Mac. And when you’re ready to premiere your movie on all your devices, iMovie Theater rolls out the red carpet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-2"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-2" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-2"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-2"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another video editing application that is considered to be at the highest end is Adobe’s Premier Pro. As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>
<h4 id="7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2"><a href="#7-Apple-Final-Cut-Pro-X-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Apple Final Cut Pro X"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/" >Apple Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The professional level video editing application for Mac is the very well known Apple Final Cut Pro X. Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-2"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-2" class="headerlink" title="8. MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.magix.com/au/movie-edit-pro/" >MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Movie Edit Pro 2021 is another affordable video editing solution for home and amateur users that now has full support for 4K videos. This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>
<h3 id="Most-Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-4K-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#Most-Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-4K-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor"></a>Most Frequently Asked Questions about 4K Video Editor</h3><h4 id="1-What-is-the-best-4k-video-editor-for-Windows-PC-2"><a href="#1-What-is-the-best-4k-video-editor-for-Windows-PC-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

For example, if you are using Filmora to handle 4K video footage, you can create a proxy smaller file, as well as preview it on a lower resolution to improve the editing efficiency. Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-2"><a href="#2-Is-there-any-free-4k-video-editor-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?"></a>2.  Is there any free 4k video editor?</h4><p>If you are running Windows10, you will find that the inbuilt Photos app only allows you to export from 540p, 720p, and 1080p, no 4K.</p>
<p>For Mac users, the good news is that you can work with 4k and 60 frames per second in the free inbuilt video editor iMovie.</p>

<p>It should be noted that 4K video editing requires a Mac from 2011 or later with at least 4GB of RAM. To playback 4K video in full resolution, you’ll need an iMac with Retina display or Mac Pro connected to a 4K display.</p>
<h4 id="3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-3"><a href="#3-CyberLink-PowerDirector-Ultra-3" class="headerlink" title="3. CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FAU.html?&r=1" >CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Video makers who want a very powerful, professional-level video editing program are often shocked by the price tag. However, they find that CyberLink PowerDirector Ultra, with a more beginner-friendly interface and easier to use, has virtually everything just as other programs with a higher price.</p>
<p>![CyberLink PowerDirector Editing Interface](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cyberlink-powerdirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -ultra-19 interface.png)</p>
<p>It’s hard to look past PowerDirector Ultra if you need 4k support, and if you don’t want to sacrifice on advanced features that allow you to create professional-looking videos, even if you are a beginner or have minimal experience with video editing.</p>
<p>This latest edition of PowerDirector supports 64-bit processors for faster editing, and of course, new support for 4K resolution videos. At under $100, CyberLink PowerDirector 19 Ultra comes amazingly close to being as advanced and capable as software that is priced multiple times more than it; making it an ideal choice for the budget-conscious video editing enthusiast.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-3"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegaspro" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>One of the higher end video editing software options is the highly renowned non-linear editor (NLE) Magix Vegas Pro. Now up to version 18, this software is used by professionals and amateurs alike. Vegas Pro 18 comes with native support for 4K video, with maximum frame sizes of up to 4096 x 4096. There is native support for XAVC and XAVC S files, plus files from Red Epic and Red One. There are a number of extras and plugins included in Vegas Pro, including DVD Architect Pro.</p>

                      alt="Vegas Pro Editing Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Complete support for 4K editing puts Vegas Pro at the forefront of software in this genre, while you can also edit SD, HD, 2K and 3D videos, using Sony’s intuitive drag and drop interface. There are a huge number of tools and effects available, allowing complete control, creativity, and flexibility within the editing environment which is easily accessible to those who may even be brand new to editing videos in an NLE application.</p>
<p>The software is available at a cost of $399(on sale)&#x2F; $599.99(regularly); and the price is the same whether you select a download version, or the physical packaged version.</p>
<h4 id="5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-3"><a href="#5-Vegas-Movie-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Vegas Movie Studio"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/moviestudiope?cpint=EURO_S3_MOVIE_AX100" >Vegas Movie Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>At only $39.99, Studio 17 Platinum is just a fraction of the cost of Sony’s fully fledged editor, Vegas Pro. Magix Movie Studio 17 Platinum is a basic video editing application, suited for the beginner and home user. With an emphasis on giving users the ability to easily create and share their videos on social media sites, or creating your own home DVDs, the workflow and interface has been designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible to use, without the extensive and more complex abilities of a high end application like Sony Vegas Pro.</p>
<p>Notable features include a simple way of selecting the best output format with the Make Movie dialog, the choice of using the Simple Edit Mode or Advanced Edit Mode, fast direct upload to YouTube 4K, Color Match plug-in, and lots more.</p>
<h4 id="6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#6-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

As with most of Adobe’s software, Premiere Pro is now part of the Creative Cloud plan. This requires subscription to use the application via Adobe’s cloud service.</p>
<p>The sheer number of features within Premiere Pro CC is extensive. But the latest version has been designed to provide a faster workflow during editing, which will be appreciated by both new and seasoned users alike. New features that are worth noting in the CC version include live text templates, which integrates seamlessly with After Effects, native support for a range of new formats, automatic backing up to the Cloud, improvements to masking and tracking, and the ability to export in new industry standard formats.</p>
<p>The minimum cost to access a CC plan that includes Premiere Pro is $20.99 per month. However many users will likely be inclined to select the $52.99 per month plan which includes Premiere Pro and After Effects, as well as Photoshop and more.</p>

Used extensively in the professional movie industry, as well as amongst amateurs, the latest version comes with full support for full resolution 4K ProRes in multiple streams (which is made for working particularly fast on the new Mac Pro).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of features worthy of listing, however some of the most important and interesting ones include the Magnetic Timeline which has been designed to avoid sync problems or small unwanted gaps when editing, easy organization of media with keywords and metadata, multicam clip editing, multi channel audio editing.</p>
<h4 id="8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-3"><a href="#8-MAGIX-Movie-Edit-Pro-2021-3" class="headerlink" title="8.

This application is available in three versions: deluxe, Plus and Premium, with the Premium version containing the most features and capabilities.</p>
<p>The inbuilt automatic wizards in the basic version of Movie Edit Pro make it easy for those with little or no experience in what can be the daunting process of editing videos. The software includes more than 1500 effects and templates, editing on up to 99 tracks (in the Plus and Premium versions). There is also support for multicam editing, and the ability to easily export your finished product to a range of media and social video websites.</p>

Filmora has pre-programmed many transitions, effects, filters and elements, which can help you make the video better and faster.</p>
