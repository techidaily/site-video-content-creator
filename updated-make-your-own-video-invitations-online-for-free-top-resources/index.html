<p>As it is now the second decade of the 21st century, data carriers like DVDs are slowly becoming obsolete. A growing number of laptop and desktop PCs no longer feature optical disc drives, while the discontinuation of the Windows Media Center marked the end of an era in which Windows OS offered a built-in DVD player.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 doesn’t have a native app that enables you to play movies or music from DVD and Blu-ray discs, and you must install a third-party DVD<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to view content from these sources. Luckily there is no shortage of media players that are compatible with Windows 10, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the <strong>best free DVD players</strong> on the market and help you choose the one that meets all your needs.</p>

With keyframes, you may modify the white balance, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and black point, among other things. Modifications for Saturation, Vibrance, Faded Film and Sharpen are also accessible.</p>
<h3 id="5-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#5-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Final Cut Pro"></a>5. Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Final Cut Pro comes with a set of robust manual color correction features that can be used to achieve a wide range of color correction and enhancement features. Creating a color correction effect and then modifying the effect’s settings in the Color inspector is how you utilize the tools. Any of the following color correction effects may be used to make manual color modifications to the color tint, brightness, and contrast of the entire clip picture.</p>
<p>Color correction capabilities in Final Cut Pro allow you to fine-tune the look of any video in your project, including still photos, by adjusting color balance, shadow levels, mid-tone thresholds, highlight levels, and much more. Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Adjusting brightness has become a “small problem” for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria – it’s too dark! However, when you have quality <strong>Video Brightness Editors</strong>, like the ones we have reviewed above, you’re in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.</p>
