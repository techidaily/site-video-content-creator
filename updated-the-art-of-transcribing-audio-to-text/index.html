<p>If you’re looking, specifically, for a clean method of doing so, then it’s understandable if you’re facing difficulty with finding the right one. There are many <strong>speech-to-text</strong> audio converters available.</p>
<p>However, not all of them are all that great in quality. In this article, we’ll be introducing a couple of converters that you can use to change <strong>audio to text</strong> as well as show you how to do it</p>

The quick answer? Yes</p>
<p>Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.</p>
<p>And, just to be very clear, there are many more <strong>speech-to-text</strong> apps like this one</p>

From apps, software, online solutions, etc. There are plenty of ways, so you can find the one that works best for you</p>
<h3 id="01Online-Speech-to-Text-—-VEED-IO"><a href="#01Online-Speech-to-Text-—-VEED-IO" class="headerlink" title="01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO"></a>01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO</h3><p>The first and most common way to turn <strong>speech-to-text</strong>—especially for those who want something more accessible no matter what device they are on—is online <strong>speech-to-text MP3</strong> converters A great example of one of these online tools is the MP3 to text converter, VEED-IO. The key feature here is that you won’t have to download or install anything to start using it Also, VEED.IO (and many other online <strong>speech-to-text</strong> converters) is FREE.</p>

<h3 id="02Windows-Dictate"><a href="#02Windows-Dictate" class="headerlink" title="02Windows Dictate"></a>02Windows Dictate</h3><p>This next one is more of a live <strong>audio-to-text</strong> tool. Or rather, a live transcriber tool, but it can be useful despite the fact, especially since, once again, it is 100% free and FREE to use. What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users. It’s there to increase accessibility for those with vision impairment, but it’s also a great way of easily converting your <strong>speech to text</strong>.</p>

Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced <strong>speech-to-text</strong> functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe. It also has support for over 150+ languages and has a convenient notes function for taking advantage of the transcription function.</p>

<h3 id="04Google-Docs"><a href="#04Google-Docs" class="headerlink" title="04Google Docs"></a>04Google Docs</h3><p>Another 100% FREE method of getting live <strong>speech</strong> <strong>to text</strong> is Google Doc’s “Voice Typing” function. You can turn this on at any time by making use of the command ‘Ctrl+Shift+S’ or by turning it on manually from the ‘Tools’ tab on a Google Document (shown in the image below). It’s a very easy way of getting your thoughts onto paper while working on other things.</p>

But, don’t worry, Windows Dictates has a Mac&#x2F;iOS counterpart It’s in the form of Apple Dictation Again, it was set up to increase accessibility for users with visual impairment, but it can be pretty useful as well for the times when your hands are too busy to actively type your thoughts down.</p>
<p>You can turn on this feature by going to your device’s ‘Accessibility’ settings and enabling ‘Voice Control’ (as is shown in the image below). It will need to be downloaded and installed onto your device, but it should begin working pretty quickly after that.</p>

<p>If you’re looking, specifically, for a clean method of doing so, then it’s understandable if you’re facing difficulty with finding the right one. There are many <strong>speech-to-text</strong> audio converters available.</p>
<p>However, not all of them are all that great in quality. In this article, we’ll be introducing a couple of converters that you can use to change <strong>audio to text</strong> as well as show you how to do it</p>

The quick answer? Yes</p>
<p>Transcribe (shown in the image below), which is available for all iOS devices, is one such app. This tool, as you might be able to guess from the name, is able to transcribe spoken audio into text. It’s especially useful for creating notes (personal use), as it means you can have your thoughts written down in an instant without ever having to lift up a pen or type it down for yourself.</p>
<p>And, just to be very clear, there are many more <strong>speech-to-text</strong> apps like this one</p>

From apps, software, online solutions, etc. There are plenty of ways, so you can find the one that works best for you</p>
<h3 id="01Online-Speech-to-Text-—-VEED-IO-1"><a href="#01Online-Speech-to-Text-—-VEED-IO-1" class="headerlink" title="01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO"></a>01Online Speech-to-Text — VEED.IO</h3><p>The first and most common way to turn <strong>speech-to-text</strong>—especially for those who want something more accessible no matter what device they are on—is online <strong>speech-to-text MP3</strong> converters A great example of one of these online tools is the MP3 to text converter, VEED-IO. The key feature here is that you won’t have to download or install anything to start using it Also, VEED.IO (and many other online <strong>speech-to-text</strong> converters) is FREE.</p>

<h3 id="02Windows-Dictate-1"><a href="#02Windows-Dictate-1" class="headerlink" title="02Windows Dictate"></a>02Windows Dictate</h3><p>This next one is more of a live <strong>audio-to-text</strong> tool. Or rather, a live transcriber tool, but it can be useful despite the fact, especially since, once again, it is 100% free and FREE to use. What we’re talking about, in this case, is Windows Dictate. This is a built-in function for Windows OS users. It’s there to increase accessibility for those with vision impairment, but it’s also a great way of easily converting your <strong>speech to text</strong>.</p>

Another notable one, besides the app ‘Transcribe’ that we introduced earlier, is the iOS app called ‘Voice to Text Pro - Transcribe.’ This particular app offers advanced <strong>speech-to-text</strong> functionalities that will allow you to either transcribe live audio or upload an MP3 to transcribe. It also has support for over 150+ languages and has a convenient notes function for taking advantage of the transcription function.</p>

<h3 id="04Google-Docs-1"><a href="#04Google-Docs-1" class="headerlink" title="04Google Docs"></a>04Google Docs</h3><p>Another 100% FREE method of getting live <strong>speech</strong> <strong>to text</strong> is Google Doc’s “Voice Typing” function. You can turn this on at any time by making use of the command ‘Ctrl+Shift+S’ or by turning it on manually from the ‘Tools’ tab on a Google Document (shown in the image below). It’s a very easy way of getting your thoughts onto paper while working on other things.</p>

But, don’t worry, Windows Dictates has a Mac&#x2F;iOS counterpart It’s in the form of Apple Dictation Again, it was set up to increase accessibility for users with visual impairment, but it can be pretty useful as well for the times when your hands are too busy to actively type your thoughts down.</p>
<p>You can turn on this feature by going to your device’s ‘Accessibility’ settings and enabling ‘Voice Control’ (as is shown in the image below). It will need to be downloaded and installed onto your device, but it should begin working pretty quickly after that.</p>

<h3 id="01Otter-ai-1"><a href="#01Otter-ai-1" class="headerlink" title="01Otter.ai"></a>01Otter.ai</h3><p>Otter.ai is an <strong>audio-to-text</strong> solution that is advertised as an automated notes-taking tool The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that is available for most devices (Mac, PC, tablets, smartphones, etc.) There is a FREE version of the software available as well.

And is perfect for transcribing live audio for a more professional setting.</p>

Also, it comes in a software version (for desktops and laptops) and an app version (for tablets and smart devices). The price of this particular piece of software is high, but there’s no denying that it produces high-quality <strong>speech-to-text</strong></p>

This is where a <strong>face generation portal</strong> comes into play. You can easily <strong>create a virtual face</strong> that looks almost like you and sometimes even better with a face generator.</p>
<p>Similarly, run a business where you want to publish your clients’ reviews without showing their real photos as they might not like the idea. You can use a good face generator online tool to create a virtual face that resembles their look and post it along with their feedback.</p>
<p>Considering the above scenarios and many others that may come up over time, the following list some of the best free online face generators to create fake faces.</p>

<p>This online portal enables you to create virtual faces by specifying the physical attributes of a character, such as gender, age, hair color, eye color, and much more. You can be as creative as you want to generate a face that appears somewhat like you with the available options. Once a look is generated, you can download and use it as needed.</p>
<p>The steps that are given below explain how you can use Generated Photos’ Faces section to create and download a virtual face:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your favorite web browser and go to the URL given above, and then you will see all free AI-generated photos on this website.</li>

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.</p>
<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Download images</strong> from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.</li>

<p>This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;</li>
<li>Click <strong>Another</strong> from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save image</strong> from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.</li>

<p>This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click.

<ul>
<li>Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click <strong>Generate Another Fake Human</strong> if you don’t like the one that appears;</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p>Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.</p>

<p>You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click <strong>Upload photo;</strong></li>
<li>Select and upload your photo from your PC to the portal and wait while Anonymizer uses AI to generate similar faces.</li>

<p>This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.</p>
<p>Generated Photos Face Generator tool is a good choice for people who don’t want to upload any photos online, and need to customize the face at maximum.</p>
<p>Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:</p>
<ul>

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.</p>
<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Download images</strong> from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.</li>

<p>This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;</li>
<li>Click <strong>Another</strong> from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save image</strong> from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Different browsers may have this feature with other names</p>

<p>This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click <strong>Generate Another Fake Human</strong> if you don’t like the one that appears;</li>
<li>Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Generate A Human</strong> button to create a less realistic image of a random person.</li>

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing.

<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative.

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows, Mac</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an industry-leading video editor. Premiere Pro CC has all the editing tools a pro video editor needs.</p>
<p>There is no automatic tracking feature in Premiere Pro to pin text to video. Therefore, you need to manually position your text and add keyframes frame by frame. But the overall effort required and the final result isn’t much different from traditional editors.</p>

<li>Import your video to the timeline</li>
<li>Add text by Pressing ‘T’ on your keyboard and clicking on the preview window (your footage)</li>
<li>Change the position &amp; duration of the text layer on the timeline according to the position &amp; duration of motion tracking</li>
<li>Make sure you’re on the frame you want to start tracking from</li>
<li>Click on your text layer → then go to effects controls</li>
<li>Change the position of the text to the point you want to track → click on the stopwatch icon to add a keyframe</li>
<li>Move a few frames forward → adjust the position again → add another keyframe</li>
<li>Don’t put the keyframes too close or too farther apart</li>
<li>Play through to check it out → adjust the position and number of keyframes if any issues arise</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole process is relatively easy, although tedious. But the process becomes very complicated when you have more dynamic motion in your clip</p>
<h3 id="3-After-Effects"><a href="#3-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3. After Effects"></a>3. After Effects</h3><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 7-day trial, $20.99&#x2F;month (individual)</p>
<p> <strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows &amp; Mac</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an editor that focuses on animation &amp; creative composition. This app has been developed as a companion to Premiere Pro for creating short &amp; flashy motion graphics and visual effects for projects.</p>
<p>Motion tracking in After Effects can be done using the Point Tracker, which has one-point and up to four-point tracking. Other tracking options include the built-in 3D Camera Tracker that lets you reverse engineer a scene and the spline tracker that enables you to track masks on an object. There is also Mocha AE, a planar tracker from BorisFX. The Point Tracker is the most flexible and versatile in After Effects. We’ll use it to pin text to video.</p>

[Main Steps]"></a>How To Do Text Motion Tracking In After Effects? [Main Steps]</h4><ul>
<li>Create a new composition&#x2F;open an old one and make sure your clip is imported</li>
<li>Create a null object by right-clicking on the window (screenshot below)</li>
<li>Select your clip → click on tracker → click on track motion</li>
<li>Two square boxes will appear</li>
<li>Move the squares to the point you want to track (make sure to select an object with relatively high contrast for easier tracking)</li>
<li>Position the smaller square on the object you want to track</li>
<li>Make the second box is big enough (not too big) so that the tracked object stays within this square in the next frame</li>
<li>Click on the analyze forward button (screenshot above)</li>
<li>If the square box fails to track the object at any frame, reposition it and move on</li>
<li>Make sure motion target is set to null object (e.g., Null 1)</li>
<li>Now add the text</li>
<li>While clicking on the pick whip tool of the text layer, drag it to the null object</li>
<li>Play through to check the result</li>
<li>You can manually change the position of the text in any frame by adjusting its position and adding a keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re done. As we stated above, other types of trackers are also available for you to experiment with. The overall tracking functionality is much better than Premiere Pro.</p>
<h3 id="4-Sony-Vegas-Pro"><a href="#4-Sony-Vegas-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4. Sony Vegas Pro"></a>4. Sony Vegas Pro</h3><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 30-day trial, minimum $19.99&#x2F;month</p>
<p><strong>Operating System:</strong>  Windows</p>
<p>Sony Vegas Pro is a non-linear video editor with the so-called “power of Artificial Intelligence.” It is one of the few editors out there that has acquired popularity among professionals and amateurs alike.</p>
<p>Text motion tracking in Vegas Pro is done using Bézier Masking FX (new update introduces a separate tab for motion tracking). The tracking process is automatic. Keyframes are created automatically frame by frame. It isn’t perfect, but it gets the job done in most cases. When it fails to track objects correctly, you can manually edit the keyframes.</p>
<h4 id="How-To-Do-Text-Motion-Tracking-In-Sony-Vegas-Pro-Main-Steps"><a href="#How-To-Do-Text-Motion-Tracking-In-Sony-Vegas-Pro-Main-Steps" class="headerlink" title="How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? [Main Steps]"></a>How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? [Main Steps]</h4><ul>
<li>Import your video</li>
<li>Click on your video → go to the starting point of text motion tracking</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Bézier Masking</strong> → drag the default one to your video</li>
<li>A new options tab will appear &amp; a square box with a circle (tracking box) will appear in the preview window</li>
<li>Go to General options → set blend to 1,000</li>
<li>Go to Mask 1 → Tracking → options → set the precision to high → set keyframe interval between 1 &amp; 5</li>
<li>Position the black dot of the tracking box to the point you want to track</li>
<li>Click on start below the keyframe interval option</li>
<li>After processing is complete → go to tools → extensions → add text to motion track → click on ok in the text position tab</li>
<li>Enter your text, edit it if you want</li>
<li>Play through to check the result</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>As we’ve seen above, all the editors have some kind of automatic tracking feature, Premiere Pro being the only manual exception. All of them do a reasonably good job when it comes to pinning text to video. Professionals would be more satisfied with the added versatility and control in After Effects. Filmora, Filmora, Vegas Pro and Premiere Pro, on the other hand, are better suited for amateurs.</p>

<h3 id="2-Premiere-Pro-CC-3"><a href="#2-Premiere-Pro-CC-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Premiere Pro CC"></a>2. Premiere Pro CC</h3><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 14-day trial, minimum $20.99&#x2F;month</p>
<p><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows, Mac</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an industry-leading video editor. Premiere Pro CC has all the editing tools a pro video editor needs.</p>
<p>There is no automatic tracking feature in Premiere Pro to pin text to video. Therefore, you need to manually position your text and add keyframes frame by frame. But the overall effort required and the final result isn’t much different from traditional editors.</p>
<h4 id="How-To-Do-Text-Motion-Tracking-In-Premiere-Pro-CC-Main-Steps-3"><a href="#How-To-Do-Text-Motion-Tracking-In-Premiere-Pro-CC-Main-Steps-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Premiere Pro CC? [Main Steps]"></a>How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Premiere Pro CC? [Main Steps]</h4><ul>
<li>Import your video to the timeline</li>
<li>Add text by Pressing ‘T’ on your keyboard and clicking on the preview window (your footage)</li>
<li>Change the position &amp; duration of the text layer on the timeline according to the position &amp; duration of motion tracking</li>
<li>Make sure you’re on the frame you want to start tracking from</li>
<li>Click on your text layer → then go to effects controls</li>
<li>Change the position of the text to the point you want to track → click on the stopwatch icon to add a keyframe</li>
<li>Move a few frames forward → adjust the position again → add another keyframe</li>
<li>Don’t put the keyframes too close or too farther apart</li>
<li>Play through to check it out → adjust the position and number of keyframes if any issues arise</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole process is relatively easy, although tedious. But the process becomes very complicated when you have more dynamic motion in your clip</p>
<h3 id="3-After-Effects-3"><a href="#3-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="3. After Effects"></a>3. After Effects</h3><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 7-day trial, $20.99&#x2F;month (individual)</p>
<p> <strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows &amp; Mac</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is an editor that focuses on animation &amp; creative composition. This app has been developed as a companion to Premiere Pro for creating short &amp; flashy motion graphics and visual effects for projects.</p>
<p>Motion tracking in After Effects can be done using the Point Tracker, which has one-point and up to four-point tracking. Other tracking options include the built-in 3D Camera Tracker that lets you reverse engineer a scene and the spline tracker that enables you to track masks on an object. There is also Mocha AE, a planar tracker from BorisFX. The Point Tracker is the most flexible and versatile in After Effects. We’ll use it to pin text to video.</p>
<h4 id="How-To-Do-Text-Motion-Tracking-In-After-Effects-Main-Steps-3"><a href="#How-To-Do-Text-Motion-Tracking-In-After-Effects-Main-Steps-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Do Text Motion Tracking In After Effects? [Main Steps]"></a>How To Do Text Motion Tracking In After Effects? [Main Steps]</h4><ul>
<li>Create a new composition&#x2F;open an old one and make sure your clip is imported</li>
<li>Create a null object by right-clicking on the window (screenshot below)</li>
<li>Select your clip → click on tracker → click on track motion</li>
<li>Two square boxes will appear</li>
<li>Move the squares to the point you want to track (make sure to select an object with relatively high contrast for easier tracking)</li>
<li>Position the smaller square on the object you want to track</li>
<li>Make the second box is big enough (not too big) so that the tracked object stays within this square in the next frame</li>
<li>Click on the analyze forward button (screenshot above)</li>
<li>If the square box fails to track the object at any frame, reposition it and move on</li>
<li>Make sure motion target is set to null object (e.g., Null 1)</li>
<li>Now add the text</li>
<li>While clicking on the pick whip tool of the text layer, drag it to the null object</li>
<li>Play through to check the result</li>
<li>You can manually change the position of the text in any frame by adjusting its position and adding a keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re done. As we stated above, other types of trackers are also available for you to experiment with. The overall tracking functionality is much better than Premiere Pro.</p>
<h3 id="4-Sony-Vegas-Pro-3"><a href="#4-Sony-Vegas-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Sony Vegas Pro"></a>4. Sony Vegas Pro</h3><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 30-day trial, minimum $19.99&#x2F;month</p>
<p><strong>Operating System:</strong>  Windows</p>
<p>Sony Vegas Pro is a non-linear video editor with the so-called “power of Artificial Intelligence.” It is one of the few editors out there that has acquired popularity among professionals and amateurs alike.</p>
<p>Text motion tracking in Vegas Pro is done using Bézier Masking FX (new update introduces a separate tab for motion tracking). The tracking process is automatic. Keyframes are created automatically frame by frame. It isn’t perfect, but it gets the job done in most cases. When it fails to track objects correctly, you can manually edit the keyframes.</p>
<h4 id="How-To-Do-Text-Motion-Tracking-In-Sony-Vegas-Pro-Main-Steps-3"><a href="#How-To-Do-Text-Motion-Tracking-In-Sony-Vegas-Pro-Main-Steps-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? [Main Steps]"></a>How To Do Text Motion Tracking In Sony Vegas Pro? [Main Steps]</h4><ul>
<li>Import your video</li>
<li>Click on your video → go to the starting point of text motion tracking</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Bézier Masking</strong> → drag the default one to your video</li>
<li>A new options tab will appear &amp; a square box with a circle (tracking box) will appear in the preview window</li>
<li>Go to General options → set blend to 1,000</li>
<li>Go to Mask 1 → Tracking → options → set the precision to high → set keyframe interval between 1 &amp; 5</li>
<li>Position the black dot of the tracking box to the point you want to track</li>
<li>Click on start below the keyframe interval option</li>
<li>After processing is complete → go to tools → extensions → add text to motion track → click on ok in the text position tab</li>
<li>Enter your text, edit it if you want</li>
<li>Play through to check the result</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>As we’ve seen above, all the editors have some kind of automatic tracking feature, Premiere Pro being the only manual exception. All of them do a reasonably good job when it comes to pinning text to video. Professionals would be more satisfied with the added versatility and control in After Effects. Filmora, Filmora, Vegas Pro and Premiere Pro, on the other hand, are better suited for amateurs.</p>
