<h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-comcast-interface.jpg"
                      alt="tivo comcast interface"
                ></p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-menu.jpg"
                      alt="comcast-menu"
                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/iphone-app.jpg"
                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming. You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p>
<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>
<h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface</h2><p> The Comcast X1 DVR system has a voice-activated interface and a completely different look and layout than their standard system has.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/x1-remoteerer.jpg"
                      alt="x1 remoteerer"
                ></p>
<p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-remotes.jpg"
                      alt="comcast remotes"
                ></p>
<p> The TiVo device menu is in standard definition, so for those who have a high definition set up, you may find this a bit distraction or fuzzy. It does come with apps for extending what the box can do, including games for kids.</p>
<p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like. Comcast’s guide covers every channel they offer, even ones that are not available on your tier of service.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-menu.jpg"
                      alt="tivo menu"
                ></p>
<p> With the TiVo Roamio, connecting to a tablet allows you to be in another room and still operate the “remote” for the TiVo DVR. Download the app onto your device and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p> TiVo’s device remote has a sleek layout called the “peanut”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-remote.jpg"
                      alt="tivo remote"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p> What it all comes down to is looking at how you use your TV, where you get your sources from, and what your budget is. Each device has its own set of things that are appealing, and its own drawbacks. For flexibility of being able to use multiple sources and devices, the TiVo is the clear winner. For cost in the long run, it’s almost a draw. For ease of connection to a TV, the Comcast box comes out on top. No matter which one you pick, you’ll never run out of great programs to watch.</p>

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-1"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-1" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-1"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-1" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>

                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-1"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-1" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-1"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-1" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming. You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p>
<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>
<h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-1"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-1" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface</h2><p> The Comcast X1 DVR system has a voice-activated interface and a completely different look and layout than their standard system has.</p>

<p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The TiVo device menu is in standard definition, so for those who have a high definition set up, you may find this a bit distraction or fuzzy. It does come with apps for extending what the box can do, including games for kids.</p>
<p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like. Comcast’s guide covers every channel they offer, even ones that are not available on your tier of service.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p> What it all comes down to is looking at how you use your TV, where you get your sources from, and what your budget is. Each device has its own set of things that are appealing, and its own drawbacks. For flexibility of being able to use multiple sources and devices, the TiVo is the clear winner. For cost in the long run, it’s almost a draw. For ease of connection to a TV, the Comcast box comes out on top. No matter which one you pick, you’ll never run out of great programs to watch.</p>

<h5 id="Ollie-Mattison-3"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison-3" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-3"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-3" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-3"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available-3" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-comcast-interface.jpg"
                      alt="tivo comcast interface"
                ></p>
<p> Comcast interface</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-menu.jpg"
                      alt="comcast-menu"
                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-3"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-3" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/iphone-app.jpg"
                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-3"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-3" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming. You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p>
<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>
<h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-3"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-3" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface</h2><p> The Comcast X1 DVR system has a voice-activated interface and a completely different look and layout than their standard system has.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/x1-remoteerer.jpg"
                      alt="x1 remoteerer"
                ></p>
<p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-remotes.jpg"
                      alt="comcast remotes"
                ></p>
<p> The TiVo device menu is in standard definition, so for those who have a high definition set up, you may find this a bit distraction or fuzzy. It does come with apps for extending what the box can do, including games for kids.</p>
<p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like. Comcast’s guide covers every channel they offer, even ones that are not available on your tier of service.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-menu.jpg"
                      alt="tivo menu"
                ></p>
<p> With the TiVo Roamio, connecting to a tablet allows you to be in another room and still operate the “remote” for the TiVo DVR. Download the app onto your device and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p> TiVo’s device remote has a sleek layout called the “peanut”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-remote.jpg"
                      alt="tivo remote"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p> What it all comes down to is looking at how you use your TV, where you get your sources from, and what your budget is. Each device has its own set of things that are appealing, and its own drawbacks. For flexibility of being able to use multiple sources and devices, the TiVo is the clear winner. For cost in the long run, it’s almost a draw. For ease of connection to a TV, the Comcast box comes out on top. No matter which one you pick, you’ll never run out of great programs to watch.</p>

We’ve decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE <strong>MP3 Converters</strong> (<strong>Windows</strong>), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter’s interface looks like.</p>
<h3 id="01EaseUs-MobiMover"><a href="#01EaseUs-MobiMover" class="headerlink" title="01EaseUs MobiMover"></a>01<strong>EaseUs MobiMover</strong></h3><p>EaseUs MobiMover is an <strong>audio converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It’s a FREEmium software though — which means that it’s use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.</p>

<h3 id="02Freemake-Video-Converter"><a href="#02Freemake-Video-Converter" class="headerlink" title="02Freemake Video Converter"></a>02<strong>Freemake Video Converter</strong></h3><p>Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="03VSDC"><a href="#03VSDC" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

<h3 id="04Convertio-co"><a href="#04Convertio-co" class="headerlink" title="04Convertio.co"></a>04<strong>Convertio.co</strong></h3><p>With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Free-Convert"><a href="#05Free-Convert" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<h3 id="06DVDVideoSoft"><a href="#06DVDVideoSoft" class="headerlink" title="06DVDVideoSoft"></a>06<strong>DVDVideoSoft</strong></h3><p>With DVDVideoSoft, we’re back to an <strong>audio-video converter for Windows 10</strong> that you have to download and install to work! It’s a FREEmium software too. That means that you’ll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.</p>

This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we’ll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> MP3 trimming&#x2F;cutting feature</p>

Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety!

So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Clean, modern interface</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio.

<p>Our next pick is another open-source, <strong>MP3 editor for Windows 10</strong>. It’s called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it’s a fairly advanced audio editing tool.

<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below).

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes"><a href="#01iTunes" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music"><a href="#02Groove-Music" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="04PowerDVD"><a href="#04PowerDVD" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

<h3 id="05Musicbee"><a href="#05Musicbee" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

This will allow you to pinpoint the best place to cut your audio!</p>

<h3 id="03VSDC-1"><a href="#03VSDC-1" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

<h3 id="05Free-Convert-1"><a href="#05Free-Convert-1" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>

<p>Next up is Ashampoo’s Music Studio 8! Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Clean, modern interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beginner-friendly editing tools</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that’s all you’re looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.</p>

<p>Our next pick is another open-source, <strong>MP3 editor for Windows 10</strong>. It’s called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it’s a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.</p>

<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn’t mean that it won’t work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.</p>

<h3 id="01iTunes-1"><a href="#01iTunes-1" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music-1"><a href="#02Groove-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="04PowerDVD-1"><a href="#04PowerDVD-1" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

<h3 id="05Musicbee-1"><a href="#05Musicbee-1" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want your finished project to sound clean, you’ll probably need a functional audio editor for that! And, for this matter, we recommend advanced video editing software like Filmora Pro.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Just in case you want to review what your converted audio sounds like, consider one of the audio players that are available for Windows and Mac!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you find that your audio needs some trimming, a quick trim with an audio cutter should do the trick. It’s very simple to do!</p>

We’ve decided to go very simple with this list, providing a brief description of all of the FREE <strong>MP3 Converters</strong> (<strong>Windows</strong>), a URL that will lead you to the website where you can get the converter, and an image that should show you how the converter’s interface looks like.</p>
<h3 id="01EaseUs-MobiMover-2"><a href="#01EaseUs-MobiMover-2" class="headerlink" title="01EaseUs MobiMover"></a>01<strong>EaseUs MobiMover</strong></h3><p>EaseUs MobiMover is an <strong>audio converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It’s a FREEmium software though — which means that it’s use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.</p>

<h3 id="02Freemake-Video-Converter-2"><a href="#02Freemake-Video-Converter-2" class="headerlink" title="02Freemake Video Converter"></a>02<strong>Freemake Video Converter</strong></h3><p>Freemake Video Converter is the first 100% FREE <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> on this list! They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>

<h3 id="03VSDC-2"><a href="#03VSDC-2" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

<h3 id="04Convertio-co-2"><a href="#04Convertio-co-2" class="headerlink" title="04Convertio.co"></a>04<strong>Convertio.co</strong></h3><p>With Convertio.co, we break the mold a bit! This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

<h3 id="05Free-Convert-2"><a href="#05Free-Convert-2" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<h3 id="06DVDVideoSoft-2"><a href="#06DVDVideoSoft-2" class="headerlink" title="06DVDVideoSoft"></a>06<strong>DVDVideoSoft</strong></h3><p>With DVDVideoSoft, we’re back to an <strong>audio-video converter for Windows 10</strong> that you have to download and install to work! It’s a FREEmium software too. That means that you’ll have to pay in order to unlock certain features. But, it works as a solid converter even without that.</p>

This list will be a little more detailed than the first, since there are many differences between the tools that we’ll be introducing (both FREE and PAID), but it should give you a clear idea on which would work best for you.</p>
<h3 id="01Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#01Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="01Wondershare Filmora"></a>01<strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></h3><p>Operating System: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of editing tools for MP3 files</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Exports high-quality end-products</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Advanced video and audio editing tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> MP3 trimming&#x2F;cutting feature</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not updated as often</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Confusing interface</p>

<p>Next up is Ashampoo’s Music Studio 8! Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Clean, modern interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beginner-friendly editing tools</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio. As you can probably guess from the name, it is, primarily, an audio editing tool. Making it a good choice if that’s all you’re looking for in a software, as it certainly keeps things simpler.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beginner-friendly audio editor</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Our next pick is another open-source, <strong>MP3 editor for Windows 10</strong>. It’s called Acoustica. And, as you can see from the image shared below, it’s a fairly advanced audio editing tool. You should note, however, that the newer versions of this product are PAID (only older models are free), which is the topic of our discussion today.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below). But, the funky interface doesn’t mean that it won’t work for you! You never know, it might be exactly the kind that helps you zoom through your projects more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes-2"><a href="#01iTunes-2" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music-2"><a href="#02Groove-Music-2" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player-2"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player-2" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="04PowerDVD-2"><a href="#04PowerDVD-2" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

<h3 id="05Musicbee-2"><a href="#05Musicbee-2" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

(Note, a lot of the audio editors that we introduced in Part 2 of this article should be capable of this! And, they all work in much the same way.)</p>

Start!"></a>01<strong>Step 1: Launch MP3 Cutter for Windows 10! Start!</strong></h3><p>First, launch the <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> that you downloaded.</p>
<p>For this example, we’ll be using Joyoshare Media Cutter. And, the way to start is to select the “Open” button, which will prompt you to choose which audio you want to cut.</p>

<h3 id="01EaseUs-MobiMover-3"><a href="#01EaseUs-MobiMover-3" class="headerlink" title="01EaseUs MobiMover"></a>01<strong>EaseUs MobiMover</strong></h3><p>EaseUs MobiMover is an <strong>audio converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11 that you can use in order to easily convert videos (in various formats) into MP3 (as is shown in the image below. It’s a FREEmium software though — which means that it’s use is limited until you purchase the paid version of the software.</p>

They keep the software updated from donations, so you can choose how much money you can spare for using the service! It’s a very simple software besides (as is shown in the image below). It does feature some video editing tools, but its main function is conversion (which includes video-to-audio conversion!)</p>

<h3 id="03VSDC-3"><a href="#03VSDC-3" class="headerlink" title="03VSDC"></a>03<strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>Much like Freemake, our next <strong>MP3 converter for Windows 10</strong> and 11, called VSDC, is completely FREE — as they run primarily on donations. That does mean that it’s not the most advanced program though — evident from the rather old-school interface (shown in the image below). But, regardless of the lack of abundance in tools, it should function just fine as an <strong>audio-video-converter for Windows 10</strong> (and vice versa.)</p>

This is not a software, but it does still work for Windows users — as it requires only that you have a working browser from which you can access the website (URL linked below!) As you can see from the image, it works much like most online MP3 converters — you upload a file from your desktop, wait for it to finish converting, and then download it!</p>

<h3 id="05Free-Convert-3"><a href="#05Free-Convert-3" class="headerlink" title="05Free Convert"></a>05<strong>Free Convert</strong></h3><p>Free Convert is another online <strong>MP3 convert for Windows 10</strong> users that would prefer not to download or install software. And, just like Covertio, it works by uploading the files you want to convert from your computer, waiting for the converters tool to finish converting it, and then downloading the finished product. It is, of course, FREE — but, similar to the first tool on this list, if you want to unlock some of its features, you’ll have to pay for the premium version.</p>

<p>Today’s Best Deals: FREE</p>
<p>Audacity is an <strong>MP3 editor (Windows 10</strong>, Max, and Linux compatible!) The difference between this tool and our first pick, Filmora Pro, is that Audacity is an open-source software — this means that it is free to use, but it also means that it might not be the most reliable as it is not updated quite as often.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> FREE, open-source software</p>

Here’s another freemium software that you can try for free — just to make sure it’s the tool that you’re looking for, but you’ll have to pay a price to use in its entirety! As you can see from the interface (shown in the image below) though, it’s quite the effective <strong>MP3 cutter for Windows 10</strong> (among other things). So, if that’s what you’re looking for, then it’s a good choice to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>

<p>As far as audio-editing goes, you’re probably going to have a difficult time finding one that is as specialized as Ocenaudio.

<p>Finally, we finish things off with Audiotool, it’s certainly not your traditional audio editor (as is evident from the image shown below).

This is a straightforward list, much like the first. And, we’ll be focusing on <strong>MP3 players for Windows 10</strong> only (although some of these will work for Mac as well!)</p>
<h3 id="01iTunes-3"><a href="#01iTunes-3" class="headerlink" title="01iTunes"></a>01<strong>iTunes</strong></h3><p>Despite appearances, iTunes actually makes for a great <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong> users. After all, it’s interface is clean and it is regularly updated. So, you never have to deal with bugs! (And just in case you weren’t aware, you can add your own original audio to your iTunes library! So, it isn’t like you have to purchase media from the iTunes store just to listen to it.)</p>

<h3 id="02Groove-Music-3"><a href="#02Groove-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="02Groove Music"></a>02<strong>Groove Music</strong></h3><p>Groove Music is a local <strong>Mp3 player for Windows 10</strong> that you can download from the Microsoft App Store. It functions much like iTunes — in that you can add original music or audio to the app library (as well as purchase audio from the store — if that’s what you want.)</p>

<h3 id="03Macgo-Media-Player-3"><a href="#03Macgo-Media-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="03Macgo Media Player"></a>03<strong>Macgo Media Player</strong></h3><p>Our next pick, Macgo, is not strictly an <strong>MP3 player for Windows 10</strong>, but it can work for that purpose if that’s all you need it for. As a media player though, it does function as a video player as well. And, like our previous picks, it’s FREE so you don’t have to worry about paying in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="04PowerDVD-3"><a href="#04PowerDVD-3" class="headerlink" title="04PowerDVD"></a>04<strong>PowerDVD</strong></h3><p>Again, our next pick is more of a general media player than strictly a <strong>MP3 Player for Windows 10</strong> users, but it works just as well if all you’re looking for is to occasionally play the audio that you’ve converted or trimmed!</p>

<h3 id="05Musicbee-3"><a href="#05Musicbee-3" class="headerlink" title="05Musicbee"></a>05<strong>Musicbee</strong></h3><p>We’re back to strictly <strong>MP3 players for Windows</strong> with Musicbee! The best part of this app is, undoubtedly, the fact that it has several view options. So, if you want, you have your audio playing from a mini audio player (rather than the full interface — as is shown below). It’s also useful for organizing your media collection!</p>

Many of you usually don’t bother until you get an alert that the disk is full.</p>
<p>Sometimes the largest drives get filled eventually. If you haven’t checked your disk space yet, use your Mac and follow the instructions given below. You may be surprised about how much space can FCPX take.</p>
<p>Here is how you will do it:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Checking the mac storage through “About this Mac”</strong></p>
<p>Now it is a bit easy to check the storage from about the section. You will find this in most of the recent MAC versions.</p>
<p>Click on the mac logo and then click on “About this mac”.</p>
<p>Click on “storage” and you will see a reference chart stacked portraying the capacity of the disk and the absolute amount of storage taken by different categories of information. Moreover, you will find out the space that is yet accessible to you.</p>
<p> <strong>Option 2: Checking the mac storage through “Disk utility”</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a Mac user, you might know that there is a disk utility app. You can easily get a readout of the available space from there.</p>
<p>Open your Finder and click “Applications” on the left side.</p>
<p>Or click the magnifying glass in the upper right to find disk utility.</p>
<p>You will find utilities in Applications. <strong>Applications&gt; utilities</strong>.</p>
<p>After the disk utility opens, you can see the available used spaces. Remember to put your hard drive’s name from the list. The popup window that opens up will also tell you the free space of any device connected to your Mac.</p>

                ></p>
<p> <strong>Option3: Checking the storage from the Finder</strong></p>
<p>You can get a preview of your storage device by clicking an item in the Finder and pressing the spacebar on your keyboard. Let’s suppose you need to check a particular document without opening it.</p>
<p>Select that document and press the spacebar. You will know what’s inside without even opening it.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Guide Here is how you can do it</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Finder and select Finder&gt;Preferences, next Click General, modify the settings and you will see the storage device on the desktop.</li>
<li>To check the available or remaining space, click the spacebar. As you click it a window popup will show you the remaining space.</li>
<li>Press the spacebar again to close the window or you can do it via command. Press Command-W.</li>
<li>Turn on the finder status bar on your window. In case you want to check the disk space frequently.</li>
<li>Open a Finder window and next open the view menu. As you select the show status bar option, you will see the number of items in the folders. In the other case, if you are viewing the folder you’ll get the idea of remaining or free space</li>
