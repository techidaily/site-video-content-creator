This could be a simple still-frame (also called “Freeze Frame”) or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.</p><p>This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.</p><p>For more tutorials on slow-motion please refer to this article: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Slow Motion Video Editing Software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Freeze-Frames-and-Slow-Motion-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#Freeze-Frames-and-Slow-Motion-in-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Freeze-Frames and Slow Motion in Final Cut Pro X"></a>Freeze-Frames and Slow Motion in Final Cut Pro X</h2><h4 id="1-STILL-FRAMES"><a href="#1-STILL-FRAMES" class="headerlink" title="1.  STILL FRAMES"></a>1.  STILL FRAMES</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed001.jpg"                      alt="still frames"                ></p><p>A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use “freeze-frame” and “still-frame” interchangeably.)</p><p>In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed002.jpg"                      alt="freeze frames"                ></p><p>This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg"                      alt="create freeze frame"                ></p><p>Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I’m making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg"                      alt="freeze frames in FCP X"                ></p><p>In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.</p><p>Very cool, except….</p><p>Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can’t change the location of the still frame.</p><p>So, here’s another way to do this.</p><p>Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg"                      alt="Playhead"                ></p><p>This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg"                      alt="match clips"                ></p><p>Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.</p><p>As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type “M”), there’s no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.</p><p>I use both these techniques in many different projects.</p><h4 id="2-HOLD-FRAME"><a href="#2-HOLD-FRAME" class="headerlink" title="2.  HOLD FRAME"></a>2.  HOLD FRAME</h4><p>A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg"                      alt="hold frame"                ></p><p>Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf-on-a-headset” Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg"                      alt="hold frames in fcp x"                ></p><p>This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg"                      alt="create hold frames"                ></p><p>Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed016.jpg"                      alt="speed016"                ></p><p>Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word “Hold” in the Retime Editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed018.jpg"                      alt="speed018"                ></p><p>To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.</p><p>NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!</p><h4 id="3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION"><a href="#3-SLOW-or-FAST-MOTION" class="headerlink" title="3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION"></a>3.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION</h4><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg" alt="fast/slow motion"></p><p>We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what’s called a “constant speed change,” where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.</p><p>WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here’s how.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg"                      alt="slow motion"                ></p><p>Select the clip who’s speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).</p><p>Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I’ll show you how in a minute.)</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg" alt="create slow/fast motion"></p><p>Three things happen at once:</p><ul><li>The duration of the clip changes</li><li>The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip</li><li>The speed of the clip changes</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg"                      alt="speed010"                ></p><p>To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).</p><p>There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg"                      alt="speed017"                ></p><p>The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.</p><p>Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg"                      alt="speed011"                ></p><p>This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:</p><ul><li>Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.</li><li>Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.</li><li>Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.</li><li>Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.</li></ul><p>You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.</p><h4 id="4-EXTRA-CREDIT"><a href="#4-EXTRA-CREDIT" class="headerlink" title="4.  EXTRA CREDIT"></a>4.  EXTRA CREDIT</h4><p>There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg"                      alt="speed012"                ></p><p>Using, again, either Modify &gt; Retime or the “Smurf” menu, select Video Quality.</p><ul><li>Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.</li><li>Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.</li><li>Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.</li></ul><p>Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.</p><p>Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.</p><hr><p>This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, a professional video editing software.

It is commonly used in editing, particularly when making things like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >wedding videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which often feature lots of photos of the happy couple.</p><p>Anyway, let’s look at how you implement the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Making-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Steps-to-Making-the-Ken-Burns-Effect-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Now that we know what is Ken Burns Effect. Let’s go over the steps to making the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Import your video. From your timeline workspace, select the clip, or highlight the section of the clip, that you want to apply the Ken Burns Effect to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-media-final-cut-pro.JPG"                      alt="import media"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Enter into the viewer mode to do this. From here, select the pop-up menu from the list of options at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Hold down both the shift key and the letter C. This is the fast way to cut out what you need. You can always stick to the right-click to cut a clip if you are more comfortable with this.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong> – scroll down until you find the Ken Burns Effect option in the control panel. The effect should now appear on your page, in the area you selected.</p><h3 id="Ken-Burns-Customization"><a href="#Ken-Burns-Customization" class="headerlink" title="Ken Burns Customization"></a>Ken Burns Customization</h3><p>You can also customize the ken burns effects in Final Cut.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – To transform from the Ken Burns Effect into customization mode, drag the green box in the viewer.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Adjust the green box’s size, shape, and height until you are happy with where it is placed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/customize-ken-burns-effects-box.JPG"                      alt="customize ken burns effects"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Checking what you have already put in place using the preview option is a good idea at this stage. You can edit mistakes out later, but when you are trying to edit for speed, it is best to get it right the first time around!</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Adjust the viewer to accommodate any changes you need to make – don’t click the done button until you are sure. That being said, you can always back-step should you mis-click. You can also just start over with the effect customization if you messed up.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Using-Keyframing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Using-Keyframing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing"></a>Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing</h2><p>Now that we know how to open and apply the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro. Let’s examine how we zoom in Final Cut Pro using keyframing. Keyframing, of course, involves <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >basic animation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that allows movement to be added to a still frame. So how do you use the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X in conjunction with keyframing? Let’s talk you through it.</p><p>You can use keyframing to zoom and pan. We will talk you through how you use it to zoom in, and you should be able to work out the rest from there.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Set the playhead at the start of the chosen clip. This is where you want the zoom effect to start from.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Click to select the effects menu. It should be at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Seek out the scale and position tools. You can use these to size your animation, decide how much of a zoom you like, and how fast it will go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/scale-and-position-final-cut.jpg"                      alt="scale and position"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Follow keyframe &gt; size &gt; position and ensure your clip is covered as you need it. You can always come back to this step a few times if you don’t get it immediately right.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong> – Set the playhead where you want the clip and animation to end. Remember – if you zoom or pan too fast, you might glitch in your footage. Do it on time for the best results.</p><p><strong>As a Pro Tip</strong>: you will be baled to view all keyframes on your clip if you select show video animation from your timeline.</p><h2 id="The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion"><a href="#The-Ken-Burns-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="The Ken Burns Conclusion"></a>The Ken Burns Conclusion</h2><p>The Ken Burns Effect is famous for a reason.

It can be used to depict ancient battles without the use of CGI.</p><p>The Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro (X) technique lets filmmakers go to places that they wouldn’t otherwise get to.

Just click on the “Film Clip” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-2.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>It will open a new window screen on your computer to select the video from the directory. Find the clip you want to import and cut. Use your mouse to select it and click the “Open” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-3.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>The video will be loaded in the “Media” folder of Filmora. The clip’s thumbnail should be visible to assure you have done everything correctly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-4.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>If you can see that, let’s go to the next step.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Drag and Drop Video to Filmora’s Timeline</strong></p><p>Select the video in the media folder by clicking over it once. Now, without leaving the hold of the left button of your mouse, slide the video down to the track in the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-5.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>After that, a message will pop up, asking about your preference for the project settings. It is recommended to choose the “Match to Media” option unless you’re an experienced video editor who knows how to play with the resolution and frame rates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-6.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>You will see the video on the timeline with its preview on the “Preview Screen” on the right side of the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-7.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Cutting Your Video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Here comes the core step you have been waiting for. But before you go any further, you need to know about the “Playhead.”</p><p>Playhead is an orange-reddish marker you can find on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-8.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>It has an important role in cutting your videos.</p><p>So, move the playhead to your desired frame and click on the “scissor” icon to make the “starting” cut.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-9.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>As soon as you do it, you will see that the single clip is now divided into two parts similar to this image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-10.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>The “Red” marked area in the above screenshot ensures a gap between the clips on the timeline. The “Yellow” arrows confirm two separate clips of the same video.</p><p>Place the two clips together as seen in this “Green” area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-11.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>And place the playhead anywhere on the clip. And click on the “scissor” icon once again to make the “ending” cut (second cut).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-12.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-13.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>If done correctly, there should be three clips now of the same video, as you can observe in this screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-14.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>Again, the “Red” area in the above photo indicates the gap, and the “Yellow” area ensures a third segment of the video.</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: The gaps you can see in the divided clips are made intentionally for understanding. Practically, Filmora doesn’t move the clip or make gaps in between after you have made the cuts.</em></p><p>Keep in mind that there are three clips on the timeline. Now, if you want to remove the second clip from the video, you need to select that portion first by clicking on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-15.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>Then, right-click on the mouse and choose “Cut” from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-16.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>Within a semi-second, the selected portion will be removed from the timeline. And you will be able to see the remaining parts of the video. Now, pull the second clip using your mouse and place it at the end of the first clip without leaving a gap in between.</p><p>Then, click the “Play” button under the preview screen to see the results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-17.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/avi-video-cutters-18.jpg"                      alt="av video cutters"                ></p><p>You can see in the above two screenshots that there’s a jump between the scenes due to cuts, confirming that video has been cut significantly.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Trimming Your Video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Remember that cutting and trimming in Filmora are two different things.

The Social Network (2010)</p><p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p><p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo.jpg"                      alt="Movie made by FCP - The girl with dragon tattoo"                ></p><p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p><p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p><p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/john-carter.jpg"                      alt="Movie made by FCP - John Carter"                ></p><p>3. John Carter (2011)</p><p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p><p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/500-days-of-summer.jpg"                      alt="Movie made by FCP - 500 days of summer"                ></p><p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p><p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p><p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/x-men-origins-wolverine.jpg"                      alt="Movie made by FCP - wolverine"                ></p><p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p><p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p><p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/burn-after-reading.jpg"                      alt="Movie made by FCP - burn after reading"                ></p><p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p><p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p><p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/no-country-for-old-men.jpg"                      alt="Movie made by FCP - No country for old man"                ></p><p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p><p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p><p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p><p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/300.jpg"                      alt="Movie made by FCP - 300"                ></p><p>8. 300 (2007)</p><p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p><p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/sky-captain.jpg"                      alt="Movie made by FCP - Sky Captain"                ></p><p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p><p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p><p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p><p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/cold-mountain.jpg"                      alt="Movie made by FCP - Cold Moutain"                ></p><p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p><p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p><p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p><p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p><hr><p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p><p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The Video Board can be opened by using three different ways:</p><ul><li>You can select audio enhancement and color correction options available below the viewer and then hit “Show Color Board”. It can be simply done by pressing <strong>CMD + 6</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-1.png"                      alt="Show Color Board”."                ></p><ul><li>On effect browser you can easily access color correction effects inside the color category; that is also easier to allocate.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-2.png"                      alt="Effect Browser"                ></p><ul><li>Choose <strong>Window</strong> and then click on <strong>Go To</strong>, you will find <strong>Color Board</strong> on the appeared drop-down menu.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-3.png"                      alt="Go to Color Board"                ></p><ul><li>All the color correction effects will start appearing in the effects section available on the video inspector.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-4.png"                      alt="Color correction effects on video inspector."                ></p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p>As soon as you start working on <strong>Color Board</strong>, it is good to open Video Scopes on your system. For this you need to click on a small icon of light switch available at the top right corner of the viewer and then select Show Video Scopes from drop-down menu. It can be also done by simply pressing Command+7.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-5.png"                      alt="select Show Video Scopes from drop down menu."                ></p><p>As soon as you make this selection, the video scopes window will automatically appear on the next viewer. Here users can easily obtain information related to the current video frame, and they can be easily configured as per need. Go to the settings option available on the top right side of the window and then hit the <strong>Waveform</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-6.png"                      alt="Go to settings option available at top right side of window and then hit Waveform option."                ></p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Now it is time to work on color correction directly. There are three types of color corrections that users need to work upon: Hue, Saturation, and Exposure. Here is some brief information about all of these:</p><p><strong>Exposure or Brightness:</strong> On the Color board window you can easily make adjustments for brightness levels of video clips. As you move on to different portions of the image ranging between dark and white parts, the scope will keep on displaying waveforms with values between 0 and 100 representing darkness and brightness respectively. The master slider available on screen helps users to make overall adjustments for brightness by using three control options: highlights for white circles, midtones for gray scale and shadows for black parts. Consider waveform values as a guide for adjustment and move controls up and down to adjust contrast as per need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-7.png"                      alt="Exposure or Brightness"                ></p><p><strong>Saturation:</strong> It refers to the richness of colors in an image. Simply select saturation pane from the color board and on the video scopes window you can use the settings menu directly to adjust saturation information for every pixel. The image pixels that are far away from the center of vectorscope circle means they are more saturated as compared to pixels that are little bit closure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-8.png"                      alt="Saturation"                ></p><p><strong>Hue:</strong>  Hue displays the actual color values in images or frames in terms of primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. Use color pane from color board to adjust hue that is displayed in the form of a rainbow on screen. It is possible to manipulate values for highlights, midtones and shadows individually as per need. Using the histogram option available on settings menu can help you to make direct adjustments for all these components.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-9.png"                      alt="Hue"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h4><p>It is possible to preview all the corrections on the original image before making them final. Simple hit the arrow with left-facing formation in the top left corner of the Color Board and then return to the video inspector. Hit on the Blue box to switch between correction On and Off options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-fcp-10.png"                      alt="correction On and Off options"                ></p><p><strong>Here’s the video tutorial on how to correct color in Final Cut Pro:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-rated-imovie-alternatives-for-android-devices/"><u>New 2024 Approved Top-Rated iMovie Alternatives for Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-transform-low-res-videos-into-high-definition-masterpieces/"><u>In 2024, Transform Low-Res Videos Into High-Definition Masterpieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-blurring-videos-on-iphone-and-android-for-2024/"><u>Updated The Ultimate Guide to Blurring Videos on iPhone and Android for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-fast-track-how-to-choose-a-reliable-youtube-to-mp4-converter/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Fast Track How to Choose a Reliable YouTube to MP4 Converter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-slow-and-steady-wins-the-game-mastering-kapwings-slow-motion-feature/"><u>Updated In 2024, Slow and Steady Wins the Game Mastering Kapwings Slow Motion Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-text-animation-tools/"><u>New 2024 Approved Top Text Animation Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-adobe-premiere-pro-tutorial-eliminate-camera-shake-and-rolling-shutter/"><u>New In 2024, Adobe Premiere Pro Tutorial Eliminate Camera Shake and Rolling Shutter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/vibrant-voices-energizing-conversations-with-subscribers/"><u>Vibrant Voices  Energizing Conversations With Subscribers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/downloading-your-youtube-watch-lists-step-by-step/"><u>Downloading Your YouTube Watch Lists  Step by Step</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/the-secret-to-stylish-borders-in-instagram-visuals-for-2024/"><u>The Secret to Stylish Borders in Instagram Visuals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/10-free-location-spoofers-to-fake-gps-location-on-your-poco-m6-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>10 Free Location Spoofers to Fake GPS Location on your Poco M6 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/7-techniques-to-lower-desktop-wm-energy-usage/"><u>7 Techniques to Lower Desktop WM Energy Usage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-expertly-engineered-10-tiktok-creators-essentials-wpc/"><u>In 2024, Expertly Engineered 10 TikTok Creators' Essentials (W/PC)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-elevating-your-photos-using-photoshops-radial-toolkit/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Your Photos Using Photoshop's Radial Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/will-pokemon-go-ban-the-account-if-you-use-pgsharp-on-realme-narzo-n53-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Realme Narzo N53 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
