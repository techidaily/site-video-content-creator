We’ll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try"></a>Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try</h2><p>In today’s world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone’s life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one’s unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin the procedure, launch Filmora and select <strong>Import Media Files</strong> to load photos and videos.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place the video in the timeline by dragging and dropping it. And now go to the Audio library to choose a music track to fit the video file.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-to-video.jpg"
                      alt="add audio to video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double click the music track in the timeline, you can change the volume, speed, and other settings here.</p>
<p>and then you can add fade-in or fade-out effects to the audio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust music in video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After you’ve finished editing, you may export the video in any of the 50+ codecs that the application supports.</p>
<h3 id="4-Cyberlink-PowerDirector-365-3"><a href="#4-Cyberlink-PowerDirector-365-3" class="headerlink" title="4  Cyberlink PowerDirector 365"></a>4  Cyberlink PowerDirector 365</h3><p><strong>Supported System</strong>: Windows, MacOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free trial for 30 days</p>
<p>The video editing program PowerDirector from CyberLink bridges the gap between professional editing and user-friendliness. It has frequently been ahead of the curve in terms of support for new formats and techniques.</p>
<p>It also comes with several features that will assist you in creating a great digital movie, complete with transitions, music, and titles. Best of all, it’s simple to use and renders quickly. PowerDirector is the best video editing program on the market.</p>
<p>The new <strong>Smart Fit Audio Duration tool</strong> allows you to change the length of background music in your movie while keeping the style and tempo of the music. When you’re down in the woods of fine-tuning video and audio features, the application’s user interface is about as plain and easy as a tool with such a massive amount of options can be, but it can still be intimidating.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To import audio clips, go to <strong>Import Media Files</strong> and choose to import audio clips straight from your portable hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Right-click on the song and select <strong>Add to Music Track</strong> or drag the music onto the playlist.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may choose from a large range of unique background music recordings. Click on the <strong>Media category</strong> in the Media Room to open a drop-down menu, where you’ll discover the <strong>Background Music</strong> selection.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add background music cyberlink powerdirector"
                ></p>
<h3 id="5-Movavi-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#5-Movavi-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="5  Movavi Video Editor"></a>5  Movavi Video Editor</h3><p><strong>Supported System</strong>: Window, macOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free trial</p>
<p>Movavi is a video editing program with a straightforward, user-friendly interface. PiP, chroma-key, titling, adding music to video, basic keyframing, and motion tracking are all included. It isn’t as feature-rich or speedy as some competitors, but it allows you to create appealing work quickly.</p>
<p>It’s time to begin the post-production procedure when your video capture is finished, and your newly obtained film has been safely transferred from your camcorder to a hard disk. You may alter the audio file of your short video in any manner you like with the Movavi video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> From the welcome box, choose to <strong>Create a projec</strong>t in full feature mode. When you’re in the editor, click the <strong>Add Media Files</strong> button to incorporate the video and audio files you want to utilize in your new project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Every file you choose will be instantly placed on the Movavi timeline, with video files will appear on the Video Track and audio files on the <strong>Audio Track</strong>. To eliminate the unnecessary section of the audio file, click the <strong>Split</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Simply press <strong>Start</strong> and wait for your movie to be exported after selecting the correct video format and setting the destination folder by deciding on the <strong>Save to</strong> section.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Any video without some background soundtrack or any music, in general, appears to be at its 50% percent. Users tend to lose interest soon if they don’t have something playing in the background all the time.</p>
<p>This is why the best Video Editor with Music reviewed in this article will ultimately do everything for you. From editing your videos and pictures, these apps are tailored to provide excellent functionality to any user. Decide on the one you liked based on the features and treat yourself to the best!</p>
