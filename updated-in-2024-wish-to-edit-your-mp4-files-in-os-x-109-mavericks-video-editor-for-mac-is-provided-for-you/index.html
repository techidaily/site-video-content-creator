<p>We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use.

The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.</p>

The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.</p>

<p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making.

You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p>

<p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Ambiance SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These sounds fill the screen space to create a virtual sense of an environment or location such as the clattering sound of dishes in a restaurant or the sound of engines on a highway.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Foley SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hard and Soft SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Hard SFX synchronizes a visual to what’s happening in the picture while SFX indicates the location to the audience.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Electronic SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These sounds are generated by instruments that create electronic-sounding effects like electronic keyboards, synthesizers, or plug-ins.</p>

A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.</p>
<p>Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.</p>
<p>Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.</p>
<p>Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.</p>
<p>Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.</p>
<p>That’s why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like <strong>Filmora</strong>. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora<img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.</p>
<p>You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.</p>

<p>Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.</p>
<p>Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience.

Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.</p>
<p>Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.</p>
<p>Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Ambiance SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These sounds fill the screen space to create a virtual sense of an environment or location such as the clattering sound of dishes in a restaurant or the sound of engines on a highway.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Foley SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hard and Soft SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Hard SFX synchronizes a visual to what’s happening in the picture while SFX indicates the location to the audience.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Electronic SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These sounds are generated by instruments that create electronic-sounding effects like electronic keyboards, synthesizers, or plug-ins.</p>

A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.</p>
<p>Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.</p>
<p>Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.</p>
<p>Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.</p>
<p>Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.</p>
<p>That’s why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like <strong>Filmora</strong>. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora<img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p> Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.</p>
<h2 id="What-Are-Public-Domain-Images"><a href="#What-Are-Public-Domain-Images" class="headerlink" title="What Are Public Domain Images?"></a>What Are Public Domain Images?</h2><p> By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain</li>
<li>A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect</li>
<li>A photo was never the subject to copyright</li>
</ul>
<p> It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.</p>

<p> Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.</p>
<h2 id="What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-1"><a href="#What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="What Are Public Domain Images?"></a>What Are Public Domain Images?</h2><p> By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain</li>
<li>A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect</li>
<li>A photo was never the subject to copyright</li>
</ul>
<p> It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.</p>
<h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images-1"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?"></a>How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?</h2><p> A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Websites-for-Downloading-Public-Domain-Images-1"><a href="#Best-Websites-for-Downloading-Public-Domain-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images"></a>Best Websites for Downloading Public Domain Images</h2><p> We’ve searched the Internet and we utilized our results to compile a collection of the most reliable websites that grant its users access to vast numbers of public domain images.

<p> Graphic designers and all other creatives in constant need of a fresh supply of public domain images don’t need a special introduction to Pexels.

<p> Finding an image you like on the Internet doesn’t take long, since almost every website you can stumble upon, contains at least one picture. This doesn’t mean that you can just download any photo and use it in your blog, online marketing campaign or for any other purpose. Moreover, stock image websites like Getty Images or iStock let you purchase the right to use a photo commercially. As a reaction to an expanding stock image industry, many photographers, museums and cultural institutions are choosing to forfeit their rights and to publish public domain images. So, in this article, we are going to take you through the ten best public domain image websites where you can download pictures for free.</p>
<h2 id="What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-2"><a href="#What-Are-Public-Domain-Images-2" class="headerlink" title="What Are Public Domain Images?"></a>What Are Public Domain Images?</h2><p> By definition, public domain images are photos, vectors or clip art that are available to anyone because their copyright has either expired or they never had a copyright owner. Consequently, anyone can use these images for both commercial or private projects without having to purchase the rights to do so. An image can enter a public domain under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists, educators or artists can use the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license to dedicate their images to the public domain</li>
<li>A picture’s copyright is no longer in effect</li>
<li>A photo was never the subject to copyright</li>
</ul>
<p> It is of utmost importance to check if an image is within the public domain before you use it publicly in order to avoid potential legal complications.</p>
<h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images-2"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Find-Public-Domain-Images-2" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?"></a>How and Where to Find Public Domain Images?</h2><p> A simple google search will reveal hundreds of websites that let you download public domain and royalty-free images. Which source you’re going to use depends on the type of image you’re looking for, since some websites are dedicated only to photography, while others feature impressive collections of public domain images of artworks. In addition, you’ll only want to download public domain images from the websites that offer information about the author because using a public domain image without crediting its author is strictly prohibited.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Graphic designers and all other creatives in constant need of a fresh supply of public domain images don’t need a special introduction to Pexels. The stock image platform is dedicated to photography and video, so you can’t use it to search for vectors or clip art.

Clicking on the Popular Searches tab will enable you to see the images from Light, Nature or Animals and it will shorten the amount of time you have to spend looking for a photo you want to download.</p>

                ></p>
<p> This is probably the largest website on the Internet where you can download public domain images. There are more than 49 million images, illustrations, vector graphics and videos available that can be downloaded for free. Some media files on Wikimedia Commons have certain restrictions, but these restrictions are mostly related to image citations, which means that you can use them only if you credit the author. Such a huge selection of media files can be overwhelming for the newcomers to the Wikimedia Commons platform, but once you grow accustomed to the website’s interface discovering images becomes a straightforward process.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All images are available in high resolution</li>
<li>Nearly all images can be used without any restrictions</li>

                ></p>
<p> For more than a decade Flickr has been a popular online destination for photographers in need of a platform that enables them to present their work. The Flickr Commons is a project that unites more than a hundred institutions in an effort to create a library of public domain images. The project makes available a stunning amount of historical photographs and it grants you access to highly esteemed collections of photographs.

                      alt="Unsplash public domain image  "
                ></p>
<p> With a library that contains over 800,000 photos, Unsplash is easily one of the largest websites that offer public domain images. All pictures on this platform are organized into different categories, which makes finding a photo you want to use in a commercial or non-commercial project a relatively simple process. Alternatively, you can insert a keyword into a search bar and Unsplash will show you the results within seconds. However, the images you can find on this platform are similar to those you can purchase on stock photography websites, although some of them have an artistic touch that is hard to find on the majority of stock photos.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent source of high-resolution photos</li>

You can browse through woodcuts, old texts or old holiday images, which makes this platform an excellent choice for anyone interested in rare images that were featured in old books. All pictures you can find on the From Old Books website are free to use on non-commercial projects, but you must pay a small fee if you want to download a high-resolution image you can use on a commercial project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Images are organized into categories</li>
<li>Access to rare images</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>

                ></p>
<p> Morguefile is a website that offers stock footage to its users, but some of the images can’t be downloaded for free. That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it. The only downside is that the images aren’t organized into categories which can make finding the images you’re searching for more difficult than it needs to be.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an account on Morguefile is free</li>
<li>All free photos can be used on commercial projects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

All photos are organized into categories like abstract, free stock photos, people or wood which makes the search simpler. However, these categories don’t contain more than a few hundred photos and some of them offer as few as five pictures you can download. All photos are in high resolution and ready for professional use. The download process can be completed effortlessly in just a few quick steps. New images are added on a weekly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>

However, the amount of public domain images this website offers is limited and if you want to download the images from the collections of works created by famous artists from the late 19th and early 20th centuries you must purchase the premium version of Viintage. The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar. The images are not organized into categories which further complicates the process of finding a public domain image you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>

Pixabay also offers advanced search tools that enable you to combine searches, search for the author of an image or group search terms. In addition, you can also browse through the photographers that contribute their images to the platform on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful search tools and various filters</li>
<li>Huge collection of public domain images</li>

<p> This is probably the largest website on the Internet where you can download public domain images. There are more than 49 million images, illustrations, vector graphics and videos available that can be downloaded for free. Some media files on Wikimedia Commons have certain restrictions, but these restrictions are mostly related to image citations, which means that you can use them only if you credit the author. Such a huge selection of media files can be overwhelming for the newcomers to the Wikimedia Commons platform, but once you grow accustomed to the website’s interface discovering images becomes a straightforward process.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All images are available in high resolution</li>
<li>Nearly all images can be used without any restrictions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Getting used to the website’s interface takes time</li>
<li>The number of search results can be overwhelming</li>

                ></p>
<p> For more than a decade Flickr has been a popular online destination for photographers in need of a platform that enables them to present their work. The Flickr Commons is a project that unites more than a hundred institutions in an effort to create a library of public domain images. The project makes available a stunning amount of historical photographs and it grants you access to highly esteemed collections of photographs. Flick Commons is perfectly suited for researchers and scholars in need of public domain photos, they can use in their essays or research papers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited access to historical photos</li>
<li>Extends the knowledge available to the general public</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p> With a library that contains over 800,000 photos, Unsplash is easily one of the largest websites that offer public domain images. All pictures on this platform are organized into different categories, which makes finding a photo you want to use in a commercial or non-commercial project a relatively simple process. Alternatively, you can insert a keyword into a search bar and Unsplash will show you the results within seconds. However, the images you can find on this platform are similar to those you can purchase on stock photography websites, although some of them have an artistic touch that is hard to find on the majority of stock photos.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent source of high-resolution photos</li>
<li>Quick and easy search</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unsplash is dedicated solely to photography</li>

This is a private collection of 2,600 images that are hard to find anywhere else on the Internet. You can browse through woodcuts, old texts or old holiday images, which makes this platform an excellent choice for anyone interested in rare images that were featured in old books. All pictures you can find on the From Old Books website are free to use on non-commercial projects, but you must pay a small fee if you want to download a high-resolution image you can use on a commercial project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Images are organized into categories</li>
<li>Access to rare images</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some images are not free</li>
<li>Rudimentary website design</li>

                ></p>
<p> Morguefile is a website that offers stock footage to its users, but some of the images can’t be downloaded for free. That’s why you must click on the Free Photos tab before you start searching for public domain images on this website. The website hosts nearly 400.000 photos, videos, and vector graphics, but you must make sure that a file you want to download is within the public domain before you download it. The only downside is that the images aren’t organized into categories which can make finding the images you’re searching for more difficult than it needs to be.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an account on Morguefile is free</li>
<li>All free photos can be used on commercial projects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Images can be organized better</li>
<li>Fewer free images than on other public domain image websites</li>
</ul>

All photos are organized into categories like abstract, free stock photos, people or wood which makes the search simpler. However, these categories don’t contain more than a few hundred photos and some of them offer as few as five pictures you can download. All photos are in high resolution and ready for professional use. The download process can be completed effortlessly in just a few quick steps. New images are added on a weekly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Professional quality of images</li>
<li>All images are free</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A limited selection of photos</li>
<li>Doesn’t offer vector graphics</li>

                ></p>
<p> NYPL Digital Gallery is an excellent resource for anyone who is not interested in stock photography. The New Your Public Library has made hundreds of thousands of historical images available to the public and you can use it to browse through items, collections or divisions. Before you enter a keyword you should click on the search only public domain materials tick box to ensure that the search results are going to display only images that can be used without restrictions.

</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>

<h4 id="10-Viintage-3"><a href="#10-Viintage-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

However, the amount of public domain images this website offers is limited and if you want to download the images from the collections of works created by famous artists from the late 19th and early 20th centuries you must purchase the premium version of Viintage. The website lacks some basic search options as it only allows you to type in the search term into the search bar. The images are not organized into categories which further complicates the process of finding a public domain image you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers a collection of rare vintage public domain images</li>
<li>A great resource for graphic designers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most images on Viintage can’t be downloaded for free</li>
<li>Search tools are far from perfect</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="How-to-Cite-Public-Domain-Images-Properly-3"><a href="#How-to-Cite-Public-Domain-Images-Properly-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Cite Public Domain Images Properly?"></a>How to Cite Public Domain Images Properly?</h2><p> If you’re planning on using a public domain image in a blog or on your website, you must cite the source from which you acquired a particular image. The image citations should include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The title of the image</li>
<li>Author’s name</li>
<li>Information about the institution at which an image is kept</li>
<li>The source from which you acquired an image</li>
</ul>
<p> In case you don’t have access to all of these information or if the information is simply not available you should include all details about a public domain image you have the access to. Furthermore, there are several styles of image citations that depend on the source from which an image was acquired.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Spending large sums of money on images you can use in commercial or private projects is not always necessary. The public domain images are widely available and they can be used in a broad range of contexts. Which website that lets you download public domain images do you like to use the most?
