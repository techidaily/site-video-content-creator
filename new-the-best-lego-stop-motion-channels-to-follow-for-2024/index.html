<p>Brickfilms, the cool name for Lego stop-motion animations, is a raging success on YouTube and other video streaming sites. No longer are you limited to build and play with your Lego sets.

<p>Start by setting up your scene. You need a flat and stable surface. It needs to be at a height where you will be comfortable working for an extended period. If you set it up on your floor, you could regret this when the aches in your knees and back kick in. Keep your set in place by using masking tape, so it doesn’t move if you accidentally bump into it.</p>

<p>I Can Animate is a way to produce movies quickly and with little need for that much tech knowledge. You can use your iOS device, whether tablet or phone, to create and then share your videos. This app is produced by Kudlian Software Ltd and retails on different prices on Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>I Can Animate is unique in its simplicity. You use the camera on your iOS device, and the app will show you the differences between frames, so you can check your progress. This is called onion skinning and is essential to the success of your animation.</p>
<p>There are some basic editing features. These features include an ability to view the images on a timeline and duplicate or reorder these. You can also change the exposure, balance and focus settings to ensure there is a replication of conditions between photographs.</p>

<p>Stop Motion Studio, produced by Cateater, is an app offered for people age 4 and over and is available on iOS and Android – for your phone or your tablet. There is also a full-featured movie editing software that you can buy for your PC and Mac.</p>
<p>The app is free to download, with some free features. However, there are in-App purchases for some of the better features. You can purchase the Stop Motion Studio Pro app at the cost of $4.99 for Android devices, which then opens all the advanced features in the app.</p>
<p>The advanced features include a function to add and adjust audio, importing and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >cropping images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as 4K Ultra HD and much more. The Green Screen function is particularly smart, as this allows you to include a background, which is preloaded onto the phone.</p>
<p>Reviews are positive. Most note that the product appears simple to use – and you can get high-quality Lego movies without feeling daunted. However, the intuitive nature of the app design belies the smart tools available for your movie production. You can add in text, speech bubbles and titles. You can add facial expressions to your Lego figures. The eraser tool is wonderful, as you can delete unwanted objects from your images.</p>

<p>This branded movie maker is free on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.moviemaker.thelegomovie2" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is suitable for children aged 8 and above, so a little more advanced than the more basic I Can Animate – but it is designed only to be used on your phone, using the in-built camera. There is the option to add sounds and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >visual effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the live footage, as well as edit material within the app. There is no save facility, which means your project needs to be sensible for the time you have before sharing to the site.</p>
<p>You will need to set up an account to be able to share your movies. However, for parents, this adds a reassuring level of moderation and support. Every video is moderated before it is shared. The set-up of the account is not too arduous. You are asked for your home country, your email address and your date of birth. All your videos will be anonymised as part of a stringent adherence to GDPR and safeguarding policies. The strength of this app is the infrastructure of a large brand that understands how to protect children. Be aware, your movie will become the property of the Lego group when uploaded.</p>
<p>Probably the most attractive selling point of this app is that there is no third-party advertising. Consequently, there are hours of uninterrupted fun offered.</p>

<li>For users 12+ with a focus on B2B adult target market</li>
<li>Unique feature – professional-level design features – with Instagram cropping guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Created by Bolandia Creative Inc., Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker is designed for a more sophisticated audience. It is available on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en_US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is aimed at users 12 and above, and there is a definite feel of a professional design package. The interface is a clean white with simple black icons for the function buttons. Essentially, the company is aiming the app at other businesses looking to produce marketing material.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the app cannot be used by Lego movie makers. The app has an intuitive interface, with simple icons that make it clear how the features can be used. There is the option to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and warmth of each image. You can also change the speed and size of images.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The apparent marketing leaning of this app is evident in the offer of Instagram crop guidelines, which will allow businesses to upload the stop-motion animations to the site. However, the in-app tutorials are excellent for helping younger people compose the Lego movies with a degree of sophistication that the other apps don’t provide. There is the option of an exposure lock, so the conditions stay the same for each photograph. You can use the ghosted image overlay, which allows you to check the difference from one frame to another.</p>
<p>Particularly useful, the grids allow you to clearly map the changes from one image to the next. This stop motion maker app helps you to track your stop-motion animation with some accuracy and it’s quite popular for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making Instagram Stop Motion Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>From the developers Yosuke Seki, this StopMotion camera is a simple tool for taking a series of images to produce your Lego movie and then play it back. You can now store the images within the app, which is new from Onion Cam1, which means you can come back to your movies and continue your work. You can also export your video with OnionCam 2.</p>
<p> The “onion” in the title comes from the onion-skin function which allows you to check the lapse between photographs. There is a translucent display of the picture you took last time – allowing you to gradually build up your time-lapse movie.</p>
<p>The guidelines are also a useful way to measure the changes you are making.</p>
<p>If you want an app that allows you to create a simple movie without too many bells and whistles, then this is the app for you. There are not too many advanced features, only the changing order function stands out. However, your young child should be able to use this app without much intervention from you.</p>

If you have both vital qualities, read on to understand how to maximise the effects in your film.</p>
<h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1. Get your timing right</h3><p>If you want your characters to move quickly, then you need fewer images and movements per second. If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p>
<h3 id="2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural"><a href="#2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural" class="headerlink" title="2. Making your characters’ movements natural"></a>2. Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li>
<li>The toe on this foot then descends</li>
<li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li>
<li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>Finding ways to produce content that stands out on social media is becoming increasingly difficult as video content is growing more popular.

<li>Unique feature – professional-level design features – with Instagram cropping guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Created by Bolandia Creative Inc., Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker is designed for a more sophisticated audience. It is available on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse&hl=en_US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is aimed at users 12 and above, and there is a definite feel of a professional design package. The interface is a clean white with simple black icons for the function buttons. Essentially, the company is aiming the app at other businesses looking to produce marketing material.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the app cannot be used by Lego movie makers. The app has an intuitive interface, with simple icons that make it clear how the features can be used. There is the option to adjust the brightness, contrast, saturation and warmth of each image. You can also change the speed and size of images.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The apparent marketing leaning of this app is evident in the offer of Instagram crop guidelines, which will allow businesses to upload the stop-motion animations to the site. However, the in-app tutorials are excellent for helping younger people compose the Lego movies with a degree of sophistication that the other apps don’t provide. There is the option of an exposure lock, so the conditions stay the same for each photograph. You can use the ghosted image overlay, which allows you to check the difference from one frame to another.</p>
<p>Particularly useful, the grids allow you to clearly map the changes from one image to the next. This stop motion maker app helps you to track your stop-motion animation with some accuracy and it’s quite popular for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >making Instagram Stop Motion Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>From the developers Yosuke Seki, this StopMotion camera is a simple tool for taking a series of images to produce your Lego movie and then play it back. You can now store the images within the app, which is new from Onion Cam1, which means you can come back to your movies and continue your work. You can also export your video with OnionCam 2.</p>
<p> The “onion” in the title comes from the onion-skin function which allows you to check the lapse between photographs. There is a translucent display of the picture you took last time – allowing you to gradually build up your time-lapse movie.</p>
<p>The guidelines are also a useful way to measure the changes you are making.</p>
<p>If you want an app that allows you to create a simple movie without too many bells and whistles, then this is the app for you. There are not too many advanced features, only the changing order function stands out. However, your young child should be able to use this app without much intervention from you.</p>

<h2 id="Basic-Tips-for-Improving-Lego-stop-motion-videos-1"><a href="#Basic-Tips-for-Improving-Lego-stop-motion-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Basic Tips for Improving Lego stop motion videos"></a>Basic Tips for Improving Lego stop motion videos</h2><p>The essential ingredients for the best Lego movies include creativity and patience. If you have both vital qualities, read on to understand how to maximise the effects in your film.</p>
<h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right-1"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1. Get your timing right</h3><p>If you want your characters to move quickly, then you need fewer images and movements per second. If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p>
<h3 id="2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural-1"><a href="#2-Making-your-characters’-movements-natural-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Making your characters’ movements natural"></a>2. Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle-1"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>
<ul>
<li>One leg will step forward, heel down, and toe up.</li>
<li>The toe on this foot then descends</li>
<li>The other leg passes the standing leg</li>
<li>The passing leg heel hits the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect-1"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4. Practice and perfect</h3><p>Finally, watch how people move in real life. Notice how the heads, arms, and legs move together. Then, try to recreate this with your Lego characters. Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

<p>Brickfilms, the cool name for Lego stop-motion animations, is a raging success on YouTube and other video streaming sites. No longer are you limited to build and play with your Lego sets. You can now use apps to bring a story alive. Drag those bricks down from the attic or pull them out of the kids’ box, as you could have a potential goldmine in your home.</p>

You only need a basic set of Lego bricks and your smartphone or iPad if you want to keep it simple. You could use a desk lamp for lighting or a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to add some professionalism should you wish.</p>
<p>Start by setting up your scene. You need a flat and stable surface. It needs to be at a height where you will be comfortable working for an extended period. If you set it up on your floor, you could regret this when the aches in your knees and back kick in. Keep your set in place by using masking tape, so it doesn’t move if you accidentally bump into it.</p>

<p>From the developers Yosuke Seki, this StopMotion camera is a simple tool for taking a series of images to produce your Lego movie and then play it back. You can now store the images within the app, which is new from Onion Cam1, which means you can come back to your movies and continue your work. You can also export your video with OnionCam 2.</p>
<p> The “onion” in the title comes from the onion-skin function which allows you to check the lapse between photographs. There is a translucent display of the picture you took last time – allowing you to gradually build up your time-lapse movie.</p>
<p>The guidelines are also a useful way to measure the changes you are making.</p>
<p>If you want an app that allows you to create a simple movie without too many bells and whistles, then this is the app for you. There are not too many advanced features, only the changing order function stands out. However, your young child should be able to use this app without much intervention from you.</p>

<h3 id="1-Get-your-timing-right-2"><a href="#1-Get-your-timing-right-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Get your timing right"></a>1.

If you’re going to slow the characters down, you need to take more pictures with more actions. Getting this right is a matter of trial and error, to begin with.</p>
<p>However, you can make this easier for yourself by planning a little. If you have a shooting rate of 15-frames per second, then you will need to plan out 15 images to fill a second of film. Each action in your movie that would last a second will need 15 pictures with gradual changes per image.</p>

Making your characters’ movements natural</h3><p>If you are not careful, your characters will move around in a jerky fashion. In real life, we ease in and ease out of actions. We start and finish an action slowly. Therefore, when taking images, use more pictures at the start and end of a movement, giving the impression of easing in and out of actions.</p>
<h3 id="3-Master-the-walk-cycle-2"><a href="#3-Master-the-walk-cycle-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Master the walk cycle"></a>3. Master the walk cycle</h3><p>A great place to start your Lego movie-making is in the perfection of the walk. Your characters will go through 4 movements in a walk.</p>

<p>This movement will likely take about 20 frames. When moving the arms, make sure the opposite arms move with the leg – so the left arm swings as the right leg is moving forward.</p>
<h3 id="4-Practice-and-perfect-2"><a href="#4-Practice-and-perfect-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Practice and perfect"></a>4.

Watch your material, reflect on what could be improved, and try again. The only way to become a great Lego movie maker is to practice, practice, and practice some more!</p>

<p>Brickfilms, the cool name for Lego stop-motion animations, is a raging success on YouTube and other video streaming sites. No longer are you limited to build and play with your Lego sets. You can now use apps to bring a story alive. Drag those bricks down from the attic or pull them out of the kids’ box, as you could have a potential goldmine in your home.</p>

You only need a basic set of Lego bricks and your smartphone or iPad if you want to keep it simple. You could use a desk lamp for lighting or a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to add some professionalism should you wish.</p>
<p>Start by setting up your scene. You need a flat and stable surface. It needs to be at a height where you will be comfortable working for an extended period. If you set it up on your floor, you could regret this when the aches in your knees and back kick in. Keep your set in place by using masking tape, so it doesn’t move if you accidentally bump into it.</p>

                      alt="I Can Animate for iOS Interface "
                ></p>
<p>I Can Animate is a way to produce movies quickly and with little need for that much tech knowledge. You can use your iOS device, whether tablet or phone, to create and then share your videos. This app is produced by Kudlian Software Ltd and retails on different prices on Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>I Can Animate is unique in its simplicity. You use the camera on your iOS device, and the app will show you the differences between frames, so you can check your progress. This is called onion skinning and is essential to the success of your animation.</p>
<p>There are some basic editing features. These features include an ability to view the images on a timeline and duplicate or reorder these. You can also change the exposure, balance and focus settings to ensure there is a replication of conditions between photographs.</p>

                ></p>
<p>A useful option is the ability to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and capture your images without returning to your device. This means you can secure your phone or tablet and avoid knocking or changing the angle by tapping on the screen. Also helpful for streamlining the filming process is the inbuilt time-lapse feature. You can automatically capture images one after another without having to return to the camera.</p>
<p>You can then share these movies by exporting them to Facebook, YouTube or Dropbox.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Stop Motion Studio, produced by Cateater, is an app offered for people age 4 and over and is available on iOS and Android – for your phone or your tablet. There is also a full-featured movie editing software that you can buy for your PC and Mac.</p>
<p>The app is free to download, with some free features. However, there are in-App purchases for some of the better features. You can purchase the Stop Motion Studio Pro app at the cost of $4.99 for Android devices, which then opens all the advanced features in the app.</p>
<p>The advanced features include a function to add and adjust audio, importing and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >cropping images <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as 4K Ultra HD and much more. The Green Screen function is particularly smart, as this allows you to include a background, which is preloaded onto the phone.</p>
<p>Reviews are positive. Most note that the product appears simple to use – and you can get high-quality Lego movies without feeling daunted. However, the intuitive nature of the app design belies the smart tools available for your movie production. You can add in text, speech bubbles and titles. You can add facial expressions to your Lego figures. The eraser tool is wonderful, as you can delete unwanted objects from your images.</p>

<p>This branded movie maker is free on iOS and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.moviemaker.thelegomovie2" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is suitable for children aged 8 and above, so a little more advanced than the more basic I Can Animate – but it is designed only to be used on your phone, using the in-built camera. There is the option to add sounds and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >visual effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the live footage, as well as edit material within the app. There is no save facility, which means your project needs to be sensible for the time you have before sharing to the site.</p>
<p>You will need to set up an account to be able to share your movies. However, for parents, this adds a reassuring level of moderation and support. Every video is moderated before it is shared. The set-up of the account is not too arduous. You are asked for your home country, your email address and your date of birth. All your videos will be anonymised as part of a stringent adherence to GDPR and safeguarding policies. The strength of this app is the infrastructure of a large brand that understands how to protect children. Be aware, your movie will become the property of the Lego group when uploaded.</p>
<p>Probably the most attractive selling point of this app is that there is no third-party advertising. Consequently, there are hours of uninterrupted fun offered.</p>

Moreover, you can create your own templates and use them on all future projects.

<p>Making a trailer or an intro for the videos you share online shouldn’t take too much of your time. This iPhone app offers an easy solution to all vloggers and video content creators who want to create trailers for their film projects from their phones. There are more than a thousand customizable templates to choose from, as well as over 700 motion stickers. In addition, the app doesn’t limit the number of titles you can add to a single project, and it lets you adjust the size, shadow and stroke values for each title you include in a video.</p>
<p>Even though the app doesn’t have a library of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free songs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can still use it to create soundtracks or even record voiceovers for your trailers. Moreover, the app’s file-sharing capabilities are underwhelming since you can only export videos to the camera roll. Purchasing the Intro Maker Premium or Premium Life Time subscription plans can be a good idea if you want to create new trailers and intros frequently.</p>

<p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making.

<p>We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.</p>

Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.</p>

You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.</p>

<p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p>

<p>It’s very common that you filmed some amazing portrait or landscape videos but in the wrong direction. This is an error made by many people because not everyone will always think about orientation when filming. Is there an easy way to flip&#x2F;rotate videos so that you can watch them without turning your head sideways?</p>
<p>What you need is just an ease to use video editor like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to flip&#x2F;rotate your video clips easily and quickly. This application offers a remarkably easy way to flip videos clockwise or anticlockwise, horizontal or vertical. What’s more, this flip software also offers a broad range of video editing features, effects and intro&#x2F;credits.</p>

<p>It’s very common that you filmed some amazing portrait or landscape videos but in the wrong direction. This is an error made by many people because not everyone will always think about orientation when filming. Is there an easy way to flip&#x2F;rotate videos so that you can watch them without turning your head sideways?</p>
<p>What you need is just an ease to use video editor like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to flip&#x2F;rotate your video clips easily and quickly. This application offers a remarkably easy way to flip videos clockwise or anticlockwise, horizontal or vertical. What’s more, this flip software also offers a broad range of video editing features, effects and intro&#x2F;credits.</p>
<p>In the following, I’ll describe how to flip a video in Windows using this video flip program. If you’re a Mac user, just adopt Wondershare Filmora X for Mac (Latest Filmora version X for Mac) to achieve the same.</p>
<p>First, please download Filmora X for free as per your operating system, and then follow the steps below.</p>

<h4 id="1-Import-Your-Original-Video-Clips-3"><a href="#1-Import-Your-Original-Video-Clips-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Import Your Original Video Clips"></a>1. Import Your Original Video Clips</h4><p>After launching Filmora X, click “New Project” to begin. Click “Import” to browse your file folder on computer or drag the video clips directly into the media library.</p>
<p>When you import all of them, click the thumbnails showing in the left pane to preview in the right screen window.</p>
<p>Note that this video editor supports an array of video &amp; audio formats, such as MOV, MP4, AVI, WMV, DV, avchd (MTS, M2TS). And still image files like JPG, BMP, JPEG, PNG. TIFF are all fully compatible.</p>
<p>And then drag your video files from media library to the video Timeline.</p>

<h4 id="2-Flip-the-Whole-Video-3"><a href="#2-Flip-the-Whole-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Flip the Whole Video"></a>2. Flip the Whole Video</h4><p>Then double click the video in the timeline to access the editing panel. In the window that appears, switch to Video tab and you will find Transform option located on the top.</p>
<p>Click on the Transform to expand the four options including Rotate, Flip, Scale and Position. To get the effect you need, you can adjust the Rotate and Flip settings and check the real-time effect in the previewing window. Though only four buttons available, you can create more options by using them together.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rotate:</strong> rotate video at any angle by entering the angle value or moving the Rotate slide: rotate 90° clockwise &amp; anti-clockwise, rotate at 180°, rotate 270°, and more</li>
<li><strong>Flip:</strong> Flip video horizontally, i.e. flip video left to right; flip video vertically that is fliping video upside down</li>
<li>You can combine Rotate and Flip feature to flip video vertically and rotate 90°clockwise or flip video vertically and rotate 90°counterclockwise.</li>
</ul>

                      alt=" Filmora 9 Transform"
                ></p>
<p>Besides, you can also change the video position and the video scale. This is the step of flips the whole part of the video.</p>
<h4 id="3-Flip-Only-a-Part-of-the-Video-3"><a href="#3-Flip-Only-a-Part-of-the-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Flip Only a Part of the Video"></a>3. Flip Only a Part of the Video</h4><p>Sometimes, you may just need to flip parts of your video file, e.g. only 1 minute instead of the whole video. In this case, you need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >split your video into separate files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and then repeat step 2 to flip them individually.</p>
<p>To do it, just move the playhead to the position you want to split, and click the “Scissors” icon in the menu bar.</p>

<h4 id="4-Export-Flipped-Video-3"><a href="#4-Export-Flipped-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="4 Export Flipped Video"></a>4 Export Flipped Video</h4><p>When you’re satisfied with the result, click “Export” in the middle right to save the flipped video. In the pop-up output window that appears, select your wanted format or configured preset for your portable player directly to watch on the go.</p>
<p>You may also want to upload your creation to YouTube or burn to DVD disc for better preservation, just go for it. Finally, click Export to let this video flip program perform the rest.</p>
