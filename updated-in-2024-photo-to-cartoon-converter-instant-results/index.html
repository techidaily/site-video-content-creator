<p>Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.</p>
<p>Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. What’s more, you don’t need a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.</p>
<p>That’s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.</p>
<h2 id="10-Best-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Makers"><a href="#10-Best-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Makers" class="headerlink" title="10+ Best Online Cartoon Photo Makers"></a>10+ Best Online Cartoon Photo Makers</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Making cartoons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> out of photos doesn’t have to be a difficult task that takes a lot of effort to complete. In fact, online cartoon photo makers are easy to use and they don’t require you to have a lot of photo editing experience.</p>
<p>We’ve selected some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best online photo editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and photo converters that enable you to cartoon your photos in just a few clicks.</p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Free-Online-Cartoon-Photo-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors"></a>Part 1: Best Free Online Cartoon Photo Editors</h3><p>You don’t have to purchase an expensive photo editing software if you want to cartoon your photos because there are so many different online photo editing platforms that allow you to apply this effect to your photos for free. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>
<h4 id="2-BeFunky"><a href="#2-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="2. BeFunky"></a>2. BeFunky</h4><p>Befunky is one of the best photo editors you can find online, which is why it is hardly surprising that it offers cartoonization effects. In fact, you can choose from <strong>five different cartoonization effects</strong> that are all equally impressive.</p>
<p>All of the cartoon effects Befunky has to offer are located in the Artsy menu, and you just have to click on Cartoonizer DLX, Cross Hatch DLX, Pop Art DLX, or Graphic Novel DLX effects in order to apply them to your photo. Furthermore, you can use the Erase mode if you don’t want to catoonize the entire photo or head over to the Adjust menu to specify the amount of the effect you’ll apply and increase or decrease the photo’s sharpness.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/" >https://www.befunky.com/features/photo-to-cartoon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you can then turn your photos to cartoon easily in BeFunky.</p>
<h4 id="3-Lunapic"><a href="#3-Lunapic" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h4><p>This is yet another online photo editing platform that gives you access to a broad range of photo editing options for free. Even though a bit outdated, the Lunapic’s interface resembles Photoshop’s interface, so you won’t need much time to get used to it if you ever used Adobe’s iconic photo editing software.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you can’t adjust the effect’s settings in case you don’t like the results.</p>
<p>If you want to add cartoon effect to photo with this photo editor, you can go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon" >https://www12.lunapic.com/editor/?action=cartoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can only adjust Glitchiness and Brightness options, while you can also toggle the Scan Line option on and off.

The Amount, Seed, Iterations, and Quality sliders allow you to fine-tune the glitch effect so that it fits the image you are editing. However, creating a text overlay with this online glitch generator is not possible as you can only use it to apply the glitch effect to photos.</p>

<li>Intuitive and functional design</li>
<li>Allows users to take photos with a webcam</li>
<li>Photos are adjusted automatically to the platform’s size requirements</li>

                ></p>
<p>What’s more, Image Glitch Tool enables you to take photos with a webcam and apply glitch effect to them just moments after you captured them.

<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Movie Maker</strong> is a basic Windows program that makes it really easy to manage basic editing, like adding music to one of your favorite videos.</li>
<li><strong>VLC Media Player</strong> is a neat little open-source program that works across different platforms for very basic use.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Movie Maker</strong> is a basic Windows program that makes it really easy to manage basic editing, like adding music to one of your favorite videos.</li>
<li><strong>VLC Media Player</strong> is a neat little open-source program that works across different platforms for very basic use.</li>

<p>This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn’t always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.</p>

<h2 id="After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere"><a href="#After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="After Effects VS Adobe Premiere"></a>After Effects VS Adobe Premiere</h2><h4 id="1Timeline"><a href="#1Timeline" class="headerlink" title="1Timeline"></a>1Timeline</h4><p>There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.</p>
<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2Editing"><a href="#2Editing" class="headerlink" title="2Editing"></a>2Editing</h4><p>In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3Audio-Mixer"><a href="#3Audio-Mixer" class="headerlink" title="3Audio Mixer"></a>3Audio Mixer</h4><p>In today’s market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn’t be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4Mercury-Playback-Engine"><a href="#4Mercury-Playback-Engine" class="headerlink" title="4Mercury Playback Engine"></a>4Mercury Playback Engine</h4><p>In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Multicam"><a href="#5-Multicam" class="headerlink" title="5 Multicam"></a>5 Multicam</h4><p>In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn’t comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="6Media-Management"><a href="#6Media-Management" class="headerlink" title="6Media Management"></a>6Media Management</h4><p>Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-6.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="7Masking"><a href="#7Masking" class="headerlink" title="7Masking"></a>7Masking</h4><p>This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.</p>

                ></p>
<h4 id="8-Camera-Tracker"><a href="#8-Camera-Tracker" class="headerlink" title="8 Camera Tracker"></a>8 Camera Tracker</h4><p>The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn’t always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other.

Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.</p>
<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>

<h4 id="2Editing-1"><a href="#2Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="2Editing"></a>2Editing</h4><p>In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.</p>

As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.</p>

<h4 id="6Media-Management-1"><a href="#6Media-Management-1" class="headerlink" title="6Media Management"></a>6Media Management</h4><p>Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.</p>

<h4 id="7Masking-1"><a href="#7Masking-1" class="headerlink" title="7Masking"></a>7Masking</h4><p>This is where After Effects comes to the fore. The ability to create masks that track through scenes is a fundamental component of After Effects workflow and why it is so good for effects creation and compositing. None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.</p>

<h4 id="8-Camera-Tracker-1"><a href="#8-Camera-Tracker-1" class="headerlink" title="8 Camera Tracker"></a>8 Camera Tracker</h4><p>The 3D camera tracker within After Effects is an incredibly useful tool designed to replicate the camera movements within a given scene to allow new layers to be added that precisely match the original scene, essential for composite work and simply not possible within Premiere.</p>

<h4 id="9-Effects-1"><a href="#9-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="9 Effects"></a>9 Effects</h4><p>The collection of specific tools within After Effects for applying motion control effects, for color control, blurring shadows transitions and titles is vast, and whilst Premiere includes some of its own, it is clear that here After Effects has the edge and it once again highlights the different approach taken by each program. Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.</p>
<p>After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I’ve seen it explained before in terms of Word and Excel. You can compose a letter in Excel and create a spreadsheet in Word with the tables functionality, but the end result will take much longer and never be quite as good doing it that way. This perhaps is the best way to explain the relationship between Premiere and After Effects.</p>
<p>Yes, a spec sheet makes the two programs seem somewhat comparable, but it is the focus of each application that shows why they differ so much. Ultimately, the best use of these programs is together, they complement each other perfectly.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most asked question regarding video processing on the internet. And looking at the product descriptions on the Adobe site gives us a clue why. There seems to be a large overlap between the two programs, and technically there is, although as we shall see capability doesn’t always mean suitability, so the similarities are not quite as pronounced as they would appear.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it is worth looking at the key differences between <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Premiere to get a clearer understanding of what is best for which situation and why you would pick one program over the other. So below are the 9 points that I will make a comparison.</p>

<h2 id="After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere-3"><a href="#After-Effects-VS-Adobe-Premiere-3" class="headerlink" title="After Effects VS Adobe Premiere"></a>After Effects VS Adobe Premiere</h2><h4 id="1Timeline-3"><a href="#1Timeline-3" class="headerlink" title="1Timeline"></a>1Timeline</h4><p>There are numerous editing differences between the two programs, but we will start with the timeline as it perhaps best illustrates the different focus of each package. Premiere has a very detailed timeline panel with a huge amount of functionality built in to move through and manipulate the contents of a project. After Effects, on the other hand, has less options for dealing with multiple clips and is designed to deal with the composite components in a more user friendly way.</p>
<p>The upshot of this would be the basic premise of the differences, for editing clips into a movie, whilst both can perform the task to an extent, Premiere’s timeline interface makes it a much easier process with many more options to make technical editing easier for the user.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-1.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2Editing-3"><a href="#2Editing-3" class="headerlink" title="2Editing"></a>2Editing</h4><p>In addition to the timeline, Premiere has an interface and toolset built for precise editing and clip manipulation, both audio and video. This is not surprising of course, Premiere is after all first and foremost an editing package. By contrast, whilst there is editing functionality within After Effects, it is neither as user friendly, nor remotely as comprehensive a tool set, and as such would not be a suitable environment for extensive editing workflow.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the crux of the differences between the two packages, for editing work Premiere offers a complete toolset far beyond the requirements for many projects, but as comprehensive as one wishes, whilst After Effects is focus more on composites and motion video work and has an editing tool set that is not conducive to efficiency and ease of use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-2.png"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3Audio-Mixer-3"><a href="#3Audio-Mixer-3" class="headerlink" title="3Audio Mixer"></a>3Audio Mixer</h4><p>In today’s market the audio component on a video product can be as important as the visual aspects, the audio clip mixer within Premiere is a professional grade tool designed to offer precise control over a projects audio output and includes the ability to use VST3 industry standard plugins. Because After Effects is primarily a composite application it lacks the finesse of Premiere where audio is concerned. Again this shouldn’t be read as being an inferior program, it simply has a different focus.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/affer-effect-3.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Premiere vs After Effects"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4Mercury-Playback-Engine-3"><a href="#4Mercury-Playback-Engine-3" class="headerlink" title="4Mercury Playback Engine"></a>4Mercury Playback Engine</h4><p>In terms of perceived functionality probably not the top of the list, but Premiere uses this to employ either software (useful) or hardware (brilliant), assuming you have a compatible graphics card, accelerated real time renderless viewing of clips and sequences. This creates a much faster workflow for editing than is possible with After Effects beyond the previously mentioned tools and interface restrictions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="5-Multicam-3"><a href="#5-Multicam-3" class="headerlink" title="5 Multicam"></a>5 Multicam</h4><p>In terms of editing this is where After Effects just isn’t comparable at all, the multi camera interface within Premiere is exceptionally featured and allows on the fly angle changes and edits and the ability to sync a single shot through numerous camera simultaneously. As said, the editing functionality on offer here is what Premiere exists for, and whilst both Premiere and After Effects are video manipulation packages, editing and composting are very different focuses, and the products reflect those differences.</p>

                ></p>
<h4 id="6Media-Management-3"><a href="#6Media-Management-3" class="headerlink" title="6Media Management"></a>6Media Management</h4><p>Often overlooked but very important for project fidelity, the media management facilities within Premiere are designed around the needs of editing production and enable a much easier organizational approach for large projects than that of After Effects.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

None of these effects are readily achievable within Premiere as it ships, and even add ons will never achieve the fluidity and ease of use the purpose designed interface provides.</p>

Premiere is primarily an editing application, it is designed to enable the fastest, most efficient and highest quality non-linear editing of a project possible. Within that framework it includes the ability, both natively and with plugins, to incorporate a limited range transitions and effects to aid the editing process.</p>
<p>After Effects, however, is an application built around effects, it is designed to allow an almost unlimited variety of effects, transitions and animations to be incorporated into a project via compositing and as such has a wealth of tools to enable the efficient workflow of those tasks, including some editing tools that would likely be needed for that job.</p>
