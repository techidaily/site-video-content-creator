<p>Subtitle Edit is a free, open-source subtitle editor that allows users to create, adjust, sync, and translate the subtitle lines seamlessly. But one of the significant drawbacks of Subtitle Edit is that it is available only for Windows users. Nevertheless, it does not mean that Mac users cannot utilize the same function and feature set. There exists some software that is almost similar to Subtitle Edit. And given that there is no option to download Subtitle Edit for Mac users — you can use its alternative and utilize the same features on a macOS environment.</p>

<h3 id="1-Aegisub"><a href="#1-Aegisub" class="headerlink" title="1. Aegisub"></a>1. Aegisub</h3><p>Free, open-source, and cross-platform program, AegiSub is the best alternative of SubtitleEdit because the software is comparable in most standards to the software. In fact, by comparison, AegiSub is substantial compared to the one in question. Including a built-in real-time video preview option, Aegisub allows users to see the look of the text on the videos while editing them. There are multiple options to edit the subtitles; for instance, you can change the size, font, and language based on preference and set it to video with exact timestamps.

                      alt=" Aegisub"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free of costs — you can donate if you like the program</li>
<li>Cross-platform — sign in with a single credentials on across all your devices and work anytime, anywhere</li>
<li>Multiple style, size, and font options</li>
<li>Built-in video preview to view the added subtitles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Price: Free software; no hidden fees</strong></p>
<h3 id="2-Jubler"><a href="#2-Jubler" class="headerlink" title="2. Jubler"></a>2. Jubler</h3><p>Another free software, Jubler, is also a viable alternative to Subtitle Edit. Having all the features same as Subtitle Edit, Jubler has enough functions and capability to stand against it with its head held high. One of the most lovable qualities of Jubler is syncing text to match video features that allow users to sync the text to exact timestamps and avoid problems like latency. But that is not it: Jubler also includes an ‘Audio Wave’ feature to let you target different parts of the video and add subtitles conveniently and easily. In all, if you need a simple Subtitle editor for a Mac — Jubler is worth looking at and trying it out. Still, given that it has limited options when it comes to Formats, collaboration, and conversation options, Jubler stands next to AegiSub in our list of best alternatives of Subtitle Edit for Mac.</p>
