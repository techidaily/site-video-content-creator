<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is the most used video editing software in all around the world. It can endure very large files and provide a great experience for video editors, facilitating every aspect of video editing. The software works on both Mac and Windows. In case we have large files, we usually turn to Adobe Premiere Pro, so, one of the most important things to do might be to cut large videos faster there. Actually, it is something not at all difficult – the steps are as follows: first, you need to import your footage and add it to the sequence (referred also as timeline, to the long horizontal window below);</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>then, you don’t need to do anything there, just open the export settings (the shortcut for which would be ctrl+m),</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>An Alternative Way to Cut Large Videos Faster on Mac with Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is the most used video editing software in all around the world. It can endure very large files and provide a great experience for video editors, facilitating every aspect of video editing. The software works on both Mac and Windows. In case we have large files, we usually turn to Adobe Premiere Pro, so, one of the most important things to do might be to cut large videos faster there. Actually, it is something not at all difficult – the steps are as follows: first, you need to import your footage and add it to the sequence (referred also as timeline, to the long horizontal window below);</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/premiere-1.jpg"
                      alt="filmora"
                ></p>
<p>then, you don’t need to do anything there, just open the export settings (the shortcut for which would be ctrl+m),</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/premiere-2.jpg"
                      alt="filmora"
                ></p>
<p>and reduce the size;</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/premiere-3.jpg"
                      alt="filmora"
                ></p>
<p>and finally, you need to click on export button to compress the video if this is already the result that you needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>An Alternative Way to Cut Large Videos Faster on Mac with Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is the most used video editing software in all around the world. It can endure very large files and provide a great experience for video editors, facilitating every aspect of video editing. The software works on both Mac and Windows. In case we have large files, we usually turn to Adobe Premiere Pro, so, one of the most important things to do might be to cut large videos faster there. Actually, it is something not at all difficult – the steps are as follows: first, you need to import your footage and add it to the sequence (referred also as timeline, to the long horizontal window below);</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/premiere-1.jpg"
                      alt="filmora"
                ></p>
<p>then, you don’t need to do anything there, just open the export settings (the shortcut for which would be ctrl+m),</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/premiere-2.jpg"
                      alt="filmora"
                ></p>
<p>and reduce the size;</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="filmora"
                ></p>
<p>and finally, you need to click on export button to compress the video if this is already the result that you needed.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want.

Clayframes is equipped with timed shutter release options that enable you to choose how frequently the app is going to take photos. Optionally, you can draw over the photos you take with Clayframes, and preview your footage at different frame rates without having to export it.

<p>Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion &amp; Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.</p>

<p>Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.</p>

In addition, you can apply a variety of visual effects to all images you take with this app or even add the end credits to the video.

<p>Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.</p>

<p>Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices. Besides offering presets that enable you to complete projects quickly, this app is also equipped with features you need to control camera settings manually. Osnap! Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo. However, if you want to import photos from your device, record voiceovers or transfer footage via WiFi you must make in-app purchases.</p>

<p>This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Recording and editing stop motion animations from Smartphones and tablets has never been easier.

<p>Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.</p>

<p>Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices. Besides offering presets that enable you to complete projects quickly, this app is also equipped with features you need to control camera settings manually. Osnap! Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo.

<p>This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.</p>

Moreover, you should consider getting the accessories for your Smartphone that will make shooting a stop motion video easier.

<p>This cross-platform app is equipped with a versatile set of stop motion animation tools that grant you complete control over all camera settings. You can adjust the white balance, ISO, and exposure manually, while the app also allows you to choose if you want to use manual or auto focus. Furthermore, Stop Motion Studio offers animation guides that enable its users to move the objects in the shot with more precision, while the app’s timeline makes it easy to navigate through large numbers of frames. Changing backgrounds, applying visual effects or creating soundtracks are just a few among numerous options Stop Motion Studio offers. Apple Watch can be used as a remote shutter release on the iOS version of the app, and you can also pair it with all DSLR cameras that have WiFi. Even though installing Stop Motion Studio on an iPhone, iPad or an Android Smartphone won’t cost you anything, you must make in-app purchases if you want to export your projects in 4K resolution or import images into the app.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want. The app’s erase tool allows you to remove rigs and all other objects you don’t want to keep in the shot. Clayframes is equipped with timed shutter release options that enable you to choose how frequently the app is going to take photos. Optionally, you can draw over the photos you take with Clayframes, and preview your footage at different frame rates without having to export it. Once you’re done making a stop motion animation, you can choose the resolution in which the video is going to be exported and decide if you want to share the video you created to Facebook or YouTube directly from the app.</p>

<p>Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion &amp; Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.</p>

<p>iPhone and iPad owners who would like to create time lapse and stop motion videos from the same app can try using iMotion. The app has Time-Lapse, Manual, WiFi Remote and Photo Library Import modes, and you can easily choose the one that best meets the demands of your project. What’s more, iMotion lets you decide if you want to capture footage with a front or rear camera and it allows you to control focus, exposure or white balance manually. The maximum duration of a stop motion movie is not limited, and you can also preview your projects at different frame rates. All projects you create with iMotion can be exported in 4K, 1080p or 720p resolutions, although shooting in 4K is only possible on newer versions of iPhones and iPads. The free version of iMotion offers only a limited range of options, and you must purchase the full version of the app if you want to use all the tools it has to offer</p>

<p>Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.</p>

<p>This cross-platform app is equipped with a versatile set of stop motion animation tools that grant you complete control over all camera settings. You can adjust the white balance, ISO, and exposure manually, while the app also allows you to choose if you want to use manual or auto focus. Furthermore, Stop Motion Studio offers animation guides that enable its users to move the objects in the shot with more precision, while the app’s timeline makes it easy to navigate through large numbers of frames. Changing backgrounds, applying visual effects or creating soundtracks are just a few among numerous options Stop Motion Studio offers. Apple Watch can be used as a remote shutter release on the iOS version of the app, and you can also pair it with all DSLR cameras that have WiFi. Even though installing Stop Motion Studio on an iPhone, iPad or an Android Smartphone won’t cost you anything, you must make in-app purchases if you want to export your projects in 4K resolution or import images into the app.</p>
<h3 id="2-Clayframes-3"><a href="#2-Clayframes-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Clayframes"></a>2. Clayframes</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $2.28</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want. The app’s erase tool allows you to remove rigs and all other objects you don’t want to keep in the shot. Clayframes is equipped with timed shutter release options that enable you to choose how frequently the app is going to take photos. Optionally, you can draw over the photos you take with Clayframes, and preview your footage at different frame rates without having to export it. Once you’re done making a stop motion animation, you can choose the resolution in which the video is going to be exported and decide if you want to share the video you created to Facebook or YouTube directly from the app.</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.0</p>
<p>Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion &amp; Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMotion-3"><a href="#4-iMotion-3" class="headerlink" title="4. iMotion"></a>4. iMotion</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.4</p>
<p>iPhone and iPad owners who would like to create time lapse and stop motion videos from the same app can try using iMotion. The app has Time-Lapse, Manual, WiFi Remote and Photo Library Import modes, and you can easily choose the one that best meets the demands of your project. What’s more, iMotion lets you decide if you want to capture footage with a front or rear camera and it allows you to control focus, exposure or white balance manually. The maximum duration of a stop motion movie is not limited, and you can also preview your projects at different frame rates. All projects you create with iMotion can be exported in 4K, 1080p or 720p resolutions, although shooting in 4K is only possible on newer versions of iPhones and iPads. The free version of iMotion offers only a limited range of options, and you must purchase the full version of the app if you want to use all the tools it has to offer</p>
<h3 id="5-Stop-Motion-Maker-3"><a href="#5-Stop-Motion-Maker-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Stop Motion Maker"></a>5.Stop Motion Maker</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  Free, offers in-app purchases</p>

<p>Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.</p>

<p>This is a must-have app for all passionate Minecraft players, as it allows them to create stop motion animations that feature all of their favorite characters. After you’ve created your Minecraft world, you can start capturing it with Stop Motion Movie Creator. The app is equipped with an onion skin tool and guides that show you how to move the objects on the screen which makes the process of creating a stop motion animation much easier. In addition, you can apply a variety of visual effects to all images you take with this app or even add the end credits to the video. Stop Motion Movie Creator grants you access to the music and sound effects from the video game, which enables you to create perfect soundtracks for the videos you make with this app. The best part is that you don’t have to create Minecraft-inspired stop motion animations since the app enables you to make videos using clay figures or Lego bricks.</p>

<p>Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.</p>
<h3 id="8-Frameographer-3"><a href="#8-Frameographer-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Frameographer"></a>8. Frameographer</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $4.99</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frameographer-stop-motion/id503347879" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  3.4</p>
<p>If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.</p>
<h3 id="9-Osnap-Pro-3"><a href="#9-Osnap-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Osnap! Pro"></a>9. Osnap! Pro</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $4.99, offers in-app purchases</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  4.7</p>
<p>Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices. Besides offering presets that enable you to complete projects quickly, this app is also equipped with features you need to control camera settings manually. Osnap! Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo. However, if you want to import photos from your device, record voiceovers or transfer footage via WiFi you must make in-app purchases.</p>
<h3 id="10-iStopMotion-3"><a href="#10-iStopMotion-3" class="headerlink" title="10. iStopMotion"></a>10. iStopMotion</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong>  $9.99</p>

<p><strong>User Ratings:</strong>  3.7</p>
<p>This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Recording and editing stop motion animations from Smartphones and tablets has never been easier. Each app for iOS and Android devices we included in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need during the process of making a stop motion animation.

<p>Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>

However, even if you have a computer setup that can easily support processing of the 4K video files, proxy editing can still be useful as it can reduce the amount of time you will have to spend on performing complex video editing tasks. Let’s take a look at some of the best video editors that support proxy editing.</p>

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>
<h4 id="2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC"><a href="#2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC" class="headerlink" title="2.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the <strong>Toggle Proxy button</strong>.</p>

<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes <strong>all mp3 files</strong> you import into a project to <strong>MOV audio files</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to <strong>import the files</strong> into a new project, <strong>select each file</strong> you want to transcode and then choose the <strong>Create Video Proxy</strong> option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only <strong>25% of the video’s original size</strong>, although you can also create proxies that have <strong>50% and 75%</strong> of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the <strong>Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices</strong> button.</p>
<h4 id="6-Shotcut"><a href="#6-Shotcut" class="headerlink" title="6. Shotcut"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this cross-platform video editor <strong>supports 4K and ProRes files</strong> that can cause it to lag at times, creating proxies in Shotcut is a highly technical process. In case you decide to make a proxy file by yourself, you will have to <strong>export a version of the file that is two or four times smaller than the original</strong>. You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to <strong>make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file</strong>, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Media submenu</strong> and select the <strong>Make Proxies</strong> option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the <strong>Assets menu</strong> that is located in <strong>the Media panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Make Proxy option</strong>. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

<p>Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>

<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project.

<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded.

<p>Once you create a new project and import all video clips you want to use in that project into the editor you should just go to the <strong>Assets menu</strong> that is located in <strong>the Media panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Make Proxy option</strong>. You will be able to continue editing while the transcoding process is still in progress, and after the source files are transcoded they will be replaced by proxies. However, making adjustments to a proxy version of a composite shot will invalidate that proxy file, which is why it is important to make all edits on that shot before you create its proxy.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the size of video clips you use in your projects is going to save you a lot of time during the video editing process. Each video editing software we featured in this article allows its users to generate proxy files effortlessly. Which video editor are you going to be using for proxy video editing?

<p>Shooting videos in high resolutions can help you create visually impressive content your followers on social media are going to adore. The only trouble is that the size of 4K videos can slow you down during the video editing process if your computer doesn’t have enough RAM memory or processing power. Additionally, quite a few inexpensive or free video editing apps don’t allow their users to create low-resolution proxy files that make the process of editing 4K videos much faster. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the best 8 video editors you can use for 4K proxy video editing.</p>
<h2 id="The-Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Proxy-Editing-in-2020-3"><a href="#The-Best-Video-Editing-Apps-for-Proxy-Editing-in-2020-3" class="headerlink" title="The Best Video Editing Apps for Proxy Editing in 2020"></a>The Best Video Editing Apps for Proxy Editing in 2020</h2><p>Some of the video editing apps we featured in this article can only run on computers that already have the advanced hardware setups. However, even if you have a computer setup that can easily support processing of the 4K video files, proxy editing can still be useful as it can reduce the amount of time you will have to spend on performing complex video editing tasks. Let’s take a look at some of the best video editors that support proxy editing.</p>
<h4 id="1-Filmora-3"><a href="#1-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, subscription plans start at $49.99 per year</p>

<p>The wide range of video editing options, support for nearly all popular video file formats or quick and simple exporting process are only a few reasons why Filmora is one of the best video editors you can use this year. Creating proxy files in Filmora is not a difficult task, because the software generates them automatically for you. You just have to choose between the <strong>1280x720p or 1920x1080p resolutions</strong> and Filmora will create proxies for all media files that are larger than the resolution you’ve selected. However, the amount of time Filmora is going to need to create proxies depends on your computer’s processing power, but also on the size and the number of the RAW files you imported into a project.</p>
<h4 id="2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC-3"><a href="#2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-CC-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Premiere Pro CC"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro CC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $20,99 per month, different subscription plans available</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best, if not the best non-linear video editing software ever created, so it is hardly surprising that you can easily create proxy files for all videos you use in a project you create in Adobe Premiere Pro. So, to create proxy files you just need to open the folder that contains those files from the <strong>Media Browser</strong> and then click on the <strong>Ingest button</strong>. You should then click on the <strong>wrench tool</strong> and pick the <strong>Create Proxies option</strong> from the drop-down menu located next to the <strong>Ingest option</strong>. Afterward, you should select one of the available resolution presets and proceed to import the footage into the project. However, before you can start editing with proxies you have to click on the <strong>Toggle Proxy button</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="3-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3"><a href="#3-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Final Cut Pro X"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/lae/final-cut-pro/" >Final Cut Pro X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, $299,99</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS</p>
<p>Transcoding media with FCPX doesn’t require too much effort, as the software offers a couple of options that make the editing process faster. You can opt to <strong>generate optimized media files</strong> by transcoding the original video clips into <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec</strong> format that shortens the amount of time needed for rendering and provides excellent quality of color that is required for compositing. The <strong>proxy media files</strong> will also be created by transcoding the videos to <strong>Apple ProRes 422 codec format</strong> that retains original aspect ratio and frame rate of the video clips you transcoded. It is also worth noting that FCPX transcodes <strong>all mp3 files</strong> you import into a project to <strong>MOV audio files</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="4-Vegas-Pro-3"><a href="#4-Vegas-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Vegas Pro"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/" >Vegas Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Subscription plans start from $249,00</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p>
<p>This video editor is often overlooked in conversations about the most powerful video editing apps, but the tools it offers are powerful enough to enable you to edit videos at a professional level. Creating proxy files in Vegas Pro is remarkably easy, as you just have to <strong>import the files</strong> into a new project, <strong>select each file</strong> you want to transcode and then choose the <strong>Create Video Proxy</strong> option from the right-click menu. Just keep in mind that you must create proxy files before you do any actual editing because otherwise, the transcoding process is not going work.</p>
<h4 id="5-Blender-3"><a href="#5-Blender-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Blender"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>Blender is a 3D modeling and VFX software that lets you track objects or use 3D painting tools among numerous other options. Even though creating proxies with this app is not a particularly complicated process, you still have to be familiar with Blender in order to make full use of its transcoding options. The software allows you to generate proxy files whose size is only <strong>25% of the video’s original size</strong>, although you can also create proxies that have <strong>50% and 75%</strong> of the video’s original size. After you’ve adjusted the transcoding settings you should simply click on the <strong>Rebuild Proxy and Timecode Indices</strong> button.</p>
<h4 id="6-Shotcut-3"><a href="#6-Shotcut-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Shotcut"></a>6. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://shotcut.org/" >Shotcut <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this cross-platform video editor <strong>supports 4K and ProRes files</strong> that can cause it to lag at times, creating proxies in Shotcut is a highly technical process. In case you decide to make a proxy file by yourself, you will have to <strong>export a version of the file that is two or four times smaller than the original</strong>. You must also remember that you have to go through the entire process of creating proxies before you make any edits. The trick to creating proxies in Shotcut is to <strong>make a project file with the larger version of the video, then replace the larger version of the file with a smaller version of that same video file</strong>, before you actually start editing. Once you’ve completed the editing process, you can then once again add the larger source file to the project and export your video in high resolution.</p>
<h4 id="7-Lightworks-3"><a href="#7-Lightworks-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Lightworks"></a>7. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lwks.com/" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $24,99 per month</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, macOS, Windows</p>
<p>The process of creating proxies in Lightworks is rather simple since you just have to import the video files you’d like to edit into the software and make sure they are selected before you right-click on them. Once the right-click menu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Media submenu</strong> and select the <strong>Make Proxies</strong> option. The amount of time Lightworks is going to need to generate the proxy files depends on the number of the source files and their size. You can then proceed to add the proxies to the timeline, edit them and Lightworks will automatically use the source files instead of proxies during the rendering process.</p>
<h4 id="8-HitFilm-Express-3"><a href="#8-HitFilm-Express-3" class="headerlink" title="8. HitFilm Express"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://fxhome.com/" >HitFilm Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p>
