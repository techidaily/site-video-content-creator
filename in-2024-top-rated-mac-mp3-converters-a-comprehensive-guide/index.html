<p>Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don’t support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren’t designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.</p>
<p>These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let’s see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.</p>

Let’s have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote"><a href="#Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.</p>
<h4 id="1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote"><a href="#1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote" class="headerlink" title="1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app’s main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-remote-desktop"
                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-pin.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-pin"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Make-Connection"><a href="#3-Make-Connection" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-connection.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-connection"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-virtual-machine"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.</p>

Let’s have a look at the methods that will enable you to gain access to all applications you need to create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-1"><a href="#Method-1-Accessing-with-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>Method 1: Accessing with Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>A simple app that is available at the Google Play Store for free will enable you to access a remote computer and use any programs installed on it from your Chromebook. There are many applications similar to Chrome Desktop Remote, but we chose it because it is simple to use, very effective and completely free.</p>
<h4 id="1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-1"><a href="#1-Install-Chromebook-Desktop-Remote-1" class="headerlink" title="1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote"></a>1.Install Chromebook Desktop Remote</h4><p>The first step is to install the Chrome Desktop Remote app on both the computers you want to pair with and your Chromebook. After the application is installed, you will be presented with two options in the app’s main screen Remote Assistance and My Computers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-remote-desktop.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-remote-desktop"
                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN-1"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN-1" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Make-Connection-1"><a href="#3-Make-Connection-1" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options-1"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options-1" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-1"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="chromebook-virtual-machine"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>

<p>Generally, for the same price, you will be able to get a better build quality, longger battery life and lighter Chromebook, compared to Mac and PC. However, it is a common knowledge that Chromebooks don’t support Windows or Mac video applications or any other apps that aren’t designed for the Chrome OS. But, if you are looking for a way to edit your videos from a Chromebook do not despair because there is a way to use Windows or Mac software. Instead of being forced to use online editors that often provide just a few basic editing options Chromebook users can access editing software that is compatible with Mac or Windows OS. There is more than just one way to gain access to Mac and Windows programs, although before getting your hopes up, you should first check if the Chromebook model you have allows you to install the necessary software.</p>
<p>These solutions may not be obvious, but using them may enable you to use professional editing software that is available for Mac and Windows operating systems. Let’s see how you can run Filmora, Final Cut Pro, Sony Vegas Pro or any other powerful video editing software from your Chromebook.</p>

                      alt="chromebook-remote-desktop"
                ></p>
<p>Choose the My Computers option, then click on Get Started button and select the Enable Remote Connections feature. Once you’ve completed these actions, accept to install the Chrome Desktop Remote Host Installer and after the installation is over, run the installer.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-PIN-3"><a href="#2-Choose-PIN-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Choose PIN"></a>2.Choose PIN</h4><p>In the next step, you will be asked to select the security PIN for the host computer, that must be numeric and that has at least six digits. After you successfully completed this task the part of the process related to the host computer is finished, although you may want to adjust power saving settings so it doesn’t go into a standby mode if it is inactive for too long.</p>

<h4 id="3-Make-Connection-3"><a href="#3-Make-Connection-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Connection"></a>3.Make Connection</h4><p>In order to establish the connection between your PC and your Chromebook, both devices must sign into the same Google account. Go to the Google Play Store, only this time from you Chromebook and click on the Launch app option, the app should already be installed on the Chromebook you are using as a consequence of Google accounts keeping in sync. After you launched the app go to My Computers option and choose the Get Started feature. Select the computer you’d like to connect to and insert the PIN. After you entered the PIN, click on the Connect option and you should be able to see the desktop of your computer in the web browser.</p>

<h4 id="4-Optimize-Options-3"><a href="#4-Optimize-Options-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Optimize Options"></a>4.Optimize Options</h4><p>Due to disparities between screen resolutions, pictures you will be able to see on your Chromebook may appear to be a little grainy. If you’d like to have a sharper and clearer image go to Options and disable Shrink to Fit feature. Furthermore, users who’d like to use video editing apps must make sure that all content they would like to edit is either on the Googe Drive because the Chrome Desktop Remote doesn’t offer a direct transfer of files as an option.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-3"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Developer-Mode-and-Installing-a-Virtual-Machine-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine"></a>Method 2: Using Developer Mode and Installing a Virtual Machine</h4><p>The second method is best suited for Chromebook owners who are already running a Linux OS on their devices. The Developer Mode can provide a powerful Linux desktop on Chrombook, although it is a slightly complicated process that can be time-consuming. Before install a Virtual Machine software on Chromebook, you should check if your Chromebook is ARM or Intel based, because Virtual Machine software can’t run on ARM powered Chromebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step of the process is to install the Linux OS from the Developer Mode on your Chromebook, then switch to the newly installed OS and start the installation of the Virtual Machine software like Virtual Box or Windows Virtual PC.</li>
<li>The next step is to install the Windows OS inside the Virtual Box or any other Virtual Machine software you decided to use. This will enable you to switch between Chrome OS and Linux OS with a simple keyboard shortcut or use editing software that is compatible with the Windows OS.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-virtual-machine.jpg"
                      alt="chromebook-virtual-machine"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you’ve successfully installed the Windows OS within the Virtual Machine software you can install video editing software that will allow you to edit videos from your Chromebook. The Virtual Machine software takes a lot of hard-drive space so that may not leave too much space for the video footage you’d like to edit with your Chromebook. Even the latest Chromebooks offer barely enough processing power required to run more demanding editing software, so using the software like the Virtual Box may limit their performance even more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chromebook owners who would like to have access to Mac and Windows video editing apps will benefit more if they choose to install the Chromebook Desktop Remote application because it is easier to use and it has performed much better than all other methods of accessing software designed for Mac, Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>Bonus: We highly recommend you to use our Filmora X following the instructions above, we optimized the app for it.</p>

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>
<h2 id="2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available"><a href="#2-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Services-available" class="headerlink" title="2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available"></a>2. TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>
<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-comcast-interface.jpg"
                      alt="tivo comcast interface"
                ></p>
<p> Comcast interface</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-menu.jpg"
                      alt="comcast-menu"
                ></p>
<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/iphone-app.jpg"
                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming. You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p>
<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>
<h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface</h2><p> The Comcast X1 DVR system has a voice-activated interface and a completely different look and layout than their standard system has.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/x1-remoteerer.jpg"
                      alt="x1 remoteerer"
                ></p>
<p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/comcast-remotes.jpg"
                      alt="comcast remotes"
                ></p>
<p> The TiVo device menu is in standard definition, so for those who have a high definition set up, you may find this a bit distraction or fuzzy. It does come with apps for extending what the box can do, including games for kids.</p>
<p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like. Comcast’s guide covers every channel they offer, even ones that are not available on your tier of service.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-menu.jpg"
                      alt="tivo menu"
                ></p>
<p> With the TiVo Roamio, connecting to a tablet allows you to be in another room and still operate the “remote” for the TiVo DVR. Download the app onto your device and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p> TiVo’s device remote has a sleek layout called the “peanut”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/tivo-remote.jpg"
                      alt="tivo remote"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p> What it all comes down to is looking at how you use your TV, where you get your sources from, and what your budget is. Each device has its own set of things that are appealing, and its own drawbacks. For flexibility of being able to use multiple sources and devices, the TiVo is the clear winner. For cost in the long run, it’s almost a draw. For ease of connection to a TV, the Comcast box comes out on top. No matter which one you pick, you’ll never run out of great programs to watch.</p>

<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>

Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>

<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>

<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>

<p> Cable, satellite, over the air broadcast, streaming internet video – never before have we had so many choices of how to receive television programming. DVR, PVR, computer hard drive, external storage device; now we have choices in how to store programs for viewing later to consider as well. So what is true and what is hype when it comes to what’s the best device? Let’s peel back the layers and look at the information.</p>
<p> First, what is a DVR? A DVR, or digital video recorder, is a device that records video from a source for playback at another time. It often comes with a television programming guide included so you can easily locate shows you want to record. Most DVRs come with large capacity hard drives, though some have flash memory cards as their storage medium. There are a variety of types that range from small storage capacity and two tuners, up through several tuners and massive hard drive storage ability. You also can pause and rewind live TV, which is great when you want to create your own sports instant replays. Most DVRs also allow you to watch one program that was previously recorded while two others are recording, though some have greater capacity.</p>
<p> A TiVo is a particular kind of DVR that was first introduced in 1999. It requires a subscription to its own programming guide that can be purchased month to month, or as a “lifetime” subscription (that means the life of the TiVo, not your life, by the way). TiVos, like cable company DVRs, can record just one show or an entire season. TiVos have a smart feature which notices which shows you are watching and recommends similar ones to you based on how you rate current programs. It also uses these ratings to suggest shows to other viewers.</p>
<p> Let’s look at a few of the main features of both so you can do a comparison. We’ll look at five factors.</p>
<h2 id="1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-2"><a href="#1-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Cost-and-rent-versus-own-2" class="headerlink" title="1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own"></a>1. TiVo vs Comcast: Cost and rent versus own</h2><p> With a Comcast DVR, you are renting it from the cable company at a cost of $10 to $16 a month, depending on your market. There are no upfront costs, and should the device fail, you can swap it at no cost at your local Comcast service center. Some folks have found that the new X1 boxes are prone to crashes, so that free swap is handy.</p>
<p> A TiVo is yours to keep as long as it lasts or as long as you want it, whichever comes first. It has an initial cost of between $200 and $600, depending on the model. Plus, you have the subscription cost on top of the unit price, which is $15 a month or $500 for a “lifetime” subscription, which TiVo may or may not give you partial credit for should your device fail and you need a new one. Like the Comcast DVRs, some TiVo boxes are less than stable. It’s the nature of electronics. TiVos also have advertising on them, which some Comcast channels do also, like MusicChoice, but not on all of them.</p>

TiVo vs Comcast: Services available</h2><p> With a DVR from Comcast, you can only record shows that are broadcast on one of Comcast’s channels or play shows that are loaded into its On Demand section. A TiVo can be connected to a number of sources, including cable via a cable card, and allow you to combine all of your viewing sources into the one box. It even connects to a high definition antenna.</p>
<p> The TiVo with cable card has access to all of the cable On Demand services, so in that sense it can replace all of the Comcast DVRs. However, the cable card is not free. It typically runs $1.50 per card per month, up to $2.50 per card on the Frontier system.</p>

<p> The menus are slightly different, as you can see below.</p>

<p> TiVo interface</p>
<p> TiVos also recognize SD and HD as just different versions of the same show, instead of different channels like Comcast does, so you can set your DVR to just record HD. This makes it somewhat harder to just record HD on a TiVo.</p>
<p> Down the road, Comcast is planning the X2 system which would have cloud recording capacity, thus ending the need for a box in your house at all. TiVo has not yet announced such a plan.</p>
<h2 id="3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-3"><a href="#3-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Connection-to-a-network-3" class="headerlink" title="3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network"></a>3. TiVo vs Comcast: Connection to a network</h2><p> TiVos can be connected to your home computer network, and the newest one, the Roamio, comes with built-in wifi, for total freedom of use. Because it’s on the network, you can stream shows from your computer through the TiVo box for later playback. It supports channels like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Instant. You can also stream shows to your Apple portable devices and then take the shows with you on the plane or to the gym, or use the device as a remote control. (Android devices will have the same capacity soon.) The network capacity also means you can use your computer to control the TiVo box and view content wherever you are.</p>
<p> Some reviewers have also noted that the network set up is not as simple as it might be, and it requires some computer knowledge and ability. Unless you have a tech person nearby, novice computer users may not wish to set up the network.</p>
<p> The iPhone app remote screen looks like this:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="iphone app"
                ></p>
<p> A TiVo does have limitations of who can access which channels. For instance, it does not stream HBOGo, nor does it interface with Apple’s TV programming. For that you still need an AppleTV device.</p>
<p> Comcast boxes simply do not network well. They are designed to broadcast the cable signals through your TV, but not on a home network. They are often easier to connect, however, just requiring a cable from the box to be plugged into the TV.</p>
<h2 id="4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-3"><a href="#4-TiVo-vs-Comcast-Recording-capacity-3" class="headerlink" title="4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity"></a>4. TiVo vs Comcast: Recording capacity</h2><p> The new TiVo, the Roamio, has as many as six tuners that can record at the same time with up to 150 hours of high definition programming. You’ll never have another scheduling conflict again!</p>
<p> TiVos have recording capacities that range from 75 to 450 hours, depending on whether it is standard definition or high definition, and which device you are using. You can choose from three models of the Roamio. The base model costs $200 and has 75 hours of capacity. The menu and features are more limited on this one than on the others. There is a middle model priced at $400 that has the same six tuners as the high-end one but can only hold 150 hours of recordings. Then the top tier model costs $600 and has 450 hours of recording capacity, all of it in high definition.</p>
<p> The Comcast X1 DVR has four tuners and it can record them simultaneously. You can watch a prerecorded program while it’s recording, too. It can hold 120 hours of HD or 600 hours of SD programming.</p>
<h2 id="5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-3"><a href="#5-TiVo-vs-Comcast-User-interface-3" class="headerlink" title="5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface"></a>5. TiVo vs Comcast: User interface</h2><p> The Comcast X1 DVR system has a voice-activated interface and a completely different look and layout than their standard system has.</p>

                ></p>
<p> The basic Comcast remote is a multi-function remote and capable of controlling all functions, but it does not have the ability to connect to a portable device like a tablet or a smartphone to have connectivity that way like a TiVo can through an app. The remote has to be line of sight in order to work.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="comcast remotes"
                ></p>
<p> The TiVo device menu is in standard definition, so for those who have a high definition set up, you may find this a bit distraction or fuzzy. It does come with apps for extending what the box can do, including games for kids.</p>
<p> Many reviewers liked the interface on the TiVo better than the grid used on the Comcast service. The TiVo programming guide allows you to delete channels you don’t watch so you’re only looking at the channels you like. Comcast’s guide covers every channel they offer, even ones that are not available on your tier of service.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p> With the TiVo Roamio, connecting to a tablet allows you to be in another room and still operate the “remote” for the TiVo DVR. Download the app onto your device and you’re ready to go.</p>
<p> TiVo’s device remote has a sleek layout called the “peanut”.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p> What it all comes down to is looking at how you use your TV, where you get your sources from, and what your budget is. Each device has its own set of things that are appealing, and its own drawbacks. For flexibility of being able to use multiple sources and devices, the TiVo is the clear winner. For cost in the long run, it’s almost a draw. For ease of connection to a TV, the Comcast box comes out on top. No matter which one you pick, you’ll never run out of great programs to watch.</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>
<h2 id="If-You-Need-to-Edit-Your-Videos-Which-Is-the-Best-Video-Editor"><a href="#If-You-Need-to-Edit-Your-Videos-Which-Is-the-Best-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="If You Need to Edit Your Videos, Which Is the Best Video Editor?"></a>If You Need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit Your Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Which Is the Best Video Editor?</h2><p>Exporting or downloading content from your camera software is a messy job. You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.</p>
<p>This is especially true when video recordings can go on for as long as 90 days at a time. If you are looking for a high-quality and flexible video editor, then <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is your only real and viable choice.

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye"><a href="#2-Security-Eye" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance" class="headerlink" title="3. Perfect Surveillance"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.perfect-surveillance.com/" >Perfect Surveillance <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

                ></p>
<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of features to play with, including a massive array of settings to fit the many types of camera that this program can be used with. You can even support the company through Patreon and get more extensions on the program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam"><a href="#8-Anycam" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam"><a href="#9-ContaCam" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-1"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-1"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-1"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.</p>
<p>This is especially true when video recordings can go on for as long as 90 days at a time.

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-1"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-1"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-1"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>

<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

<p>The Genius Vision system is a fairly advanced piece of software that is probably best used for businesses. If used at home, then there are many features that may never be used. It also works on mobile devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Genius Vision Features</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Works in-depth with many types of camera</p>
<p>The tools are very sophisticated and accurate</p>
<p>The drop-down menus are complicated while also being thoughtfully laid out</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam-1"><a href="#9-ContaCam-1" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-2"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-2"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-2"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.</p>

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-2"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-2"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-2"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Getting paid upgrades is trickier than just buying on their website</p>
<p>Setting up the remote features is difficult</p>
<p>You have to figure out most of how to use the program based on which camera you have connected</p>

<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam-2"><a href="#8-Anycam-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam-2"><a href="#9-ContaCam-2" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>

<p>Figuring out which is the best security camera software is never easy. This is because most of the software you find online says it is free…until you download their software and it tries to charge you.</p>
<p>Here is a review of the best security camera software, and every single one has a free option. Share this article on social media if you find the right camera software for you.</p>
<p>But if you are new in this field, then you might want to know some basic technique terms introduced following, before we jump to choose the best security camera software.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-an-IP-Camera-3"><a href="#What-Is-an-IP-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is an IP Camera?"></a>What Is an IP Camera?</h2><p>When people say, “IP camera,” they usually mean a camera that uses the Internet in some way so that it may do its job. A typical CCTV camera connects a camera to a computer via a wire. An IP camera can connect over the Internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the connection is remote. This means that the camera may be in one location and still be connected to another computer that is miles away.</p>
<p>However, many IP cameras are installed in a home and only travel a few feet&#x2F;meters to the nearest computer. In short, an IP camera doesn’t need a local recording device because the signal can be sent over the Internet or with a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-3"><a href="#What-Is-Camera-Software-Used-for-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Camera Software Used for?"></a>What Is Camera Software Used for?</h2><p>Most people and businesses use camera software to connect their cameras to their computers or their Smartphones. This is often cheaper than buying dedicated recording hardware. The camera and its software are usually used to monitor camera feeds that are life, and to records them onto a hard drive or to the Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Pick-the-Best-Security-Camera-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?"></a>How Do You Pick the Best Security Camera Software?</h2><p>In most cases, the best software is simply the software that works with your cameras, and that offers all the functions you need. Compatibility is the first concern, but you also want it to work well with your device. For example, if your cameras have a zoom function, but your software doesn’t allow zooming, then that piece of software is not the best one for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Linux, then you want Linux security camera software. And, some people insist that their software allows them to monitor their cameras from their Smartphones. The great thing about free security camera software is that you can test it out first without the risk of losing your money.</p>

You often need a good video editor and trimmer to make your video clips usable.</p>
<p>This is especially true when video recordings can go on for as long as 90 days at a time.

<h4 id="1-NetCam-Studio-3"><a href="#1-NetCam-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. NetCam Studio"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.netcamstudio.com/Pricing" >NetCam Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>There is a free version of NetCam Studio, but if you want something more powerful, then you can buy one of their licenses. These licenses allow you to use the software for as long as you like, and they will update the software for up to two years after purchase.</p>
<p>After the two-year period, you can keep the software running as normal, but if you want upgrades, then you will have to buy them. Upgrades shouldn’t be needed unless you buy a new piece of camera hardware and it requires a new type of camera software.</p>
<p><strong>The NetCam Studio Features</strong></p>
<p>If you go for the free version of NetCam Studio, then you get to use a camera feed from two sources. There is a watermark added to the camera images, and you get five-day notifications. There is also community support.</p>
<p>The paid features include up to 64 sources, no watermarks, 250-day notifications, and you get priority support. After the 250 days is up, you may buy upgrades in order to keep the notification system going.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The free version does not expire in any way besides the notifications</p>
<p>You are able to use this software with a wide variety of camera brands</p>
<p>Updates are frequent enough to tackle most system-breaking bugs</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface needs updating to make it more user friendly</p>
<p>They need to better explain the “Add Source” procedure</p>
<p>Troubleshooting audio problems is very difficult</p>
<h4 id="2-Security-Eye-3"><a href="#2-Security-Eye-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Security Eye"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.security-eye-software.com/" >Security Eye <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The reason Security Eye ranks so highly is that it is a professional piece of software that somebody decided should be free. It is not open source security camera software, but the developers have decided that it should be free. There used to be a free version where you would get 2 hours of free surveillance per day for free, but in 2019 the company removed its payment system. Will they keep it up or go back to paid subscriptions? Who knows, but you should get it while it is still free (if you can).</p>
<p><strong>Security Eye Features</strong></p>
<p>You can use a timer to determine when the video feed should start. You can capture images as JPEGs and then compress them. The system also allows you to receive alerts via a loudspeaker. It works with motion-detection devices too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It comes with the Xvid MPEG-4 Codec</p>
<p>The full version has no nag screen or recording limit</p>
<p>The Security Eye interface is pretty modern for what is essentially a free piece of software</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Demands 1GB of RAM and 2GB of HHD space</p>
<p>Requires at least an Intel Pentium 1.8 processor</p>
<p>The icons should be more intuitive</p>
<h4 id="3-Perfect-Surveillance-3"><a href="#3-Perfect-Surveillance-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

                ></p>
<p>There are three types of free security camera software for you to choose from. There is one for IP cameras, one for web cameras, and there is a piece of viewing software that people may use if they do not have something like VLC video viewer installed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Surveillance Features</strong></p>
<p>Simple icons and a clear interface is a great benefits. Determine when the cameras start monitoring and set up your own layouts to suit your viewing style.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A simple program that works in a very uncomplicated manner</p>
<p>Most of its icons are intuitive to where you can guess what they do</p>
<p>The Perfect Surveillance system has motion detection and allows you to monitor up to 64 devices</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing seems overly long and bloated</p>
<p>There are not enough instructions on how to get your cameras connected</p>
<p>They do not explain how to capture and export screenshots</p>
<h4 id="4-iVideon-3"><a href="#4-iVideon-3" class="headerlink" title="4. iVideon"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ivideon.com/" >iVideon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>There are times when a piece of free software simply does its job good enough to warrant no complaints, and that is exactly what iVideon offers. There are plenty of ways it can be improved, but there is nothing about it that demands harsh criticism.</p>
<p><strong>iVideon Features</strong></p>
<p>One of its most advertised features is facial recognition, but it is not very accurate. It does allow for very good mobile usage. You can view live and recorded footage on your desktop or mobile device. It is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Online home use and access is completely full-featured and freeware</p>
<p>It has smart notifications and has its own desktop and mobile apps</p>
<p>it doesn’t take long to learn how to use the iVideon interface</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Seems rather light on features</p>
<p>Installing and connecting cameras requires a better tutorial</p>
<p>Embedding live video on your website is trickier than it first seems</p>

<p>This program has plenty of features, but most of them are locked off to free users. It takes over too long to learn how to use the system, but it may be worth it if you have many cameras. The paid version has all sorts of perks from SMS texts to system health monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Xeoma Features</strong></p>
<p>The lite version is the free version. It allows you to add four cameras with up to six modules in each chain. You can test out and use the lite version as long as you like, or you can get a free trial of the larger fully-featured program.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>Record and monitor from four cameras</p>
<p>Updates are very frequent</p>
<p>This software works with mostly every type of camera</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Around 90% of features are locked off to free users.</p>
<p>Xeoma is difficult to learn and set up</p>
<p>Connecting many cameras is difficult because the system is difficult to learn as a whole</p>

<p>The Deskshare IP Camera Viewer company has a great piece of security camera software that they repackage into many different names and then give away on their website. They do this because the software comes with lots of unwanted bloatware that the company is paid to promote. The sad part is that many other websites will replace this bloatware with Trojan viruses, which means it is difficult to get a clean version of this program.</p>
<p><strong>Deskshare IP Camera Viewer Features</strong></p>
<p>Live recording, playback, and split-screen is all available. You can use up to 4 cameras at a time, and it works with 2200 different camera models. If your hardware allows it, then you can pan, tilt and zoom your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>It is compatible with many types of camera brand</p>
<p>You can set up floating surveillance windows if you want</p>
<p>Adjust the properties of each camera individually</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Installing is very difficult to do correctly</p>
<p>Comes with bloatware and&#x2F;or unwanted content</p>
<p>The IP software has the least features of all the Deskshare camera software</p>
<h4 id="8-Anycam-3"><a href="#8-Anycam-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Anycam"></a>8. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://anycam.io/" >Anycam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img

                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The Anycam system is a very average piece of software, but it works with most any type of camera. The interface is basic but easy to use and easy to set up. You will discover that the free version is only limited in terms of record time, you can still use all its features.</p>
<p><strong>Anycam Features</strong></p>
<p>Anycam is mostly featureless. It works with motion-detection cameras. It allows for video recording and playback. Plus, you can watch a live feed. Other than that, there is very little you can do with this basic-but-effective piece of software.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>The program seems to work with any type of camera</p>
<p>Anycam has a paid version where you only make a one-time payment and get free lifetime updates</p>
<p>Installing and setup is very easy</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Trying to find specific events on the timeline is very fiddly</p>
<p>The free version only allows two cameras to be linked</p>
<p>The recording is very limited with the free version</p>
<h4 id="9-ContaCam-3"><a href="#9-ContaCam-3" class="headerlink" title="9. ContaCam"></a>9. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.contaware.com/donationware-license.html" >ContaCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contacam.jpg"
                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>In the strictest terms, this piece of software is not free. The developers ask you for a donation, but there is nothing forcing you to give them one. Plus, you can try the software, and then if it turns out to be brilliant, then you can always go back and donate to them.</p>
<p><strong>ContaCam Features</strong></p>
<p>Despite seeming very complicated, the interface is actually very self-explanatory. At first glance, it looks overly condensed and full of features, but each explains itself very well. You can configure the cameras very precisely to the point where you can even specify within which seconds it starts and stops.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A rather advanced piece of software</p>
<p>The interface layout is very condensed without being confusing</p>
<p>You can use web servers, the Internet, or intranet to receive live feeds</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>The interface has no aesthetic decoration at all</p>
<p>ContaCam takes a long time to learn through trial and error testing</p>
<p>The developers say this will never work with mobile devices</p>
<h4 id="10-Agent-DVR-3"><a href="#10-Agent-DVR-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Agent DVR"></a>10. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Security-Related/Agent-DVR.shtml" >Agent DVR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/agent-dvr.jpg"
                      alt="best free security camera software"
                ></p>
<p>The great thing about Agent DVR is that it is completely free because it is freeware. The sad part is that it was created by a developer who went on to finer things and left the program lodged on a few high-use servers. It is now being passed around freeware websites, which means it is sometimes difficult to find a clean version. Nevertheless, it is a fine piece of camera software that still works for many types of cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Agent DVR Features</strong></p>
<p>The Agent DVR software allows for video surveillance with a live feed, and for recording. You can use it with motion-detection software, and it still works for many different types of cameras. It uses a reliable SSL algorithm for its signal encryption, and it is very lightweight, which means it is not a big drain on your device’s CPU.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<p>A very simple and lightweight piece of software</p>
<p>Works all the way back to Windows 7</p>
<p>It still works with motion detection systems</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<p>Agent DVR will become more obsolete as newer cameras appear over the coming years</p>
<p>Updates will never occur beyond Windows 10</p>
<p>The interface looks very dated compared to the modern camera software</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can tell by this article, getting good security camera software is difficult because there is so much to choose from. Plus, installing is often an issue, as is companies trying to nag-free users into paying. There is also the issue of connecting cameras and the problem with tagged-on viruses and bloatware.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is plenty to try without having to pay, so that is a positive. What do you think?</p>
<p>Have any of these worked for you? Ask your friends on social media, start a discussion, and share this article to help others discover the best free security camera software.</p>
