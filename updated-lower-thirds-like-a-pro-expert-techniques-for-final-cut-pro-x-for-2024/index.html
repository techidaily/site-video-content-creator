Work on the below attributes to build a good lower third element. Always remember to keep it simple to obtain the desired outcomes.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The harmony of hues</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The color combinations of your lower third element play a vital factor. Choose the right mix of shades to attract the viewers.

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Motion effect</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Thrill your audience by inserting movements with the lower third elements. When you add some motion effect to this module, it adds flavors to your video. Work on this feature in-depth and observe whether the lower third’s motion effect excites the audience. Customize the animation time, style, and the way it flashes on the screen.</p>
<p>Make the movements simple and do not add too many moves which distract the viewers. Decide how long the animation should play and align the texts and other related elements according to obtain a perfect look. With the perfect text movements, you can draw the attention of the viewers in no time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fonts</strong></li>

</ol>
<p>Now, you must sense the time for the module to turn up on the video. The timing factor contributes a lot to the perfect display of the lower third element.</p>
<p>Set the right time for the element to enter the screen. Decide the enter and exit timing attribute for this element to reach the audience in a better way.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Logos and positions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Position the element at the perfect place on the screen to ensure its visibility. You can also insert your logos along with the texts to enhance your brand.</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-TTS"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-TTS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is TTS?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is TTS?</strong></h2><p>What is Text-to-Speech? Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>
<p><img

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

It’s the online <strong>text to human voice converter</strong>, NaturalReader (URL has been provided below!) You can use this tool either directly or on your desktop (a software version is available.) It is FREEmium software though. That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png"
                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png"
                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png"
                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-1"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-1" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>

After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

It’s the online <strong>text to human voice converter</strong>, NaturalReader (URL has been provided below!) You can use this tool either directly or on your desktop (a software version is available.) It is FREEmium software though. That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png"
                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png"
                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png"
                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

<p>“I need to convert some general audio files to AIFF, do you have any recommendations?”</p>
<p>We do, in fact, have some recommendations for you! The AIFF file format, while generally obscure, is accepted by most general audio converters! So, we didn’t have any problem finding some that you can use to <strong>AIFF converter</strong>!</p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

<p>Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we’ll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac’s <strong>AIFF Converter</strong></p>

<p>**<strong>3. Online Converter</strong></p>
<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>**<strong>5. EaseUS Video Converter</strong></p>
<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>This next software, the ‘Wondershare UniConverter’ is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.</p>

<p>This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>. It’s not the most efficient, but with iTunes’ AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).</p>

This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF-1"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF-1" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-1"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-1" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

<p>Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we’ll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac’s <strong>AIFF Converter</strong></p>

<p>**<strong>3. Online Converter</strong></p>
<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>**<strong>5. EaseUS Video Converter</strong></p>
<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>This next software, the ‘Wondershare UniConverter’ is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.</p>

It’s not the most efficient, but with iTunes’ AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).</p>

This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF-2"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF-2" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-2"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-2" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

<p>Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we’ll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac’s <strong>AIFF Converter</strong></p>

<p>**<strong>3. Online Converter</strong></p>
<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>**<strong>5. EaseUS Video Converter</strong></p>
<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>This next software, the ‘Wondershare UniConverter’ is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.</p>

It’s not the most efficient, but with iTunes’ AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).</p>

This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

Is it really all that good? And, if it is, why? For the first part of this article, we’ve prepared a short overview on the AIFF file format You can skip ahead though if you’d prefer to see the tutorial on <strong>AIFF Converters</strong> or our list of recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-AIFF-3"><a href="#01What’s-AIFF-3" class="headerlink" title="01What’s AIFF?"></a>01<strong>What’s AIFF?</strong></h3><p>AIFF, also called the Audio Interchange File Format, is an audio file format that was popularized in 1988. It was based on the Electronic Arts Interchange File Format and is probably most familiar for Mac users. It’s accepted by most media players, including Apple Music and the Apple QuickTime Player.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-3"><a href="#02Why-Is-It-So-Popular-3" class="headerlink" title="02Why Is It So Popular?"></a>02<strong>Why Is It So Popular?</strong></h3><p>Why? Well, it all has to do with the loss of quality. AIFF files are notable because they are uncompressed — leading to an inarguably better sound. That makes it popular with content creators, who want to provide the best possible listening experience to their audience. The caveat to this, of course, is that its uncompressed state means that it takes up a lot more space on one’s disk drive. But, many people would be willing to give that up in exchange for the enhanced sound.</p>

The benefit of using an online converter like the one we’ll be showing you how to use is that it is usually FREE and very efficient. This makes it a perfect solution for those who are just looking to convert to or from AIFF occasionally and thus has no need for a more permanent solution.</p>

For our example, we’ve chosen FreeConvert, but there are plenty of other ones out there for you to choose from</p>
<p>Once you’re on-site, make use of the upload options to prepare your file to be converted. In this case, we uploaded an MP3 file, but it will work for M4A to AIFF just as well (along with other file formats.)</p>

And then we’ll be following it up with a long list of all the best AIFF Converters available online and for both Windows and Mac users</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Use-Free-Audio-AIFF-Converter-on-Win-Mac-3"><a href="#01How-to-Use-Free-Audio-AIFF-Converter-on-Win-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="01How to Use Free Audio AIFF Converter on Win&#x2F;Mac?"></a>01<strong>How to Use Free Audio AIFF Converter on Win&#x2F;Mac?</strong></h3><p>As promised, this first part is a demonstration on how you can <strong>convert M4A to AIFF</strong> with a converter that will work for both Windows and Mac. This free audio converter is called ‘MediaHuman Audio Converter.’ It’s a really simple converter and is a great option for those who see themselves requiring an audio converter often but still don’t feel it necessary to cough up extra money for premium software when they can get a free one</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File(s) for Conversion</strong></p>
<p>First things first, upload the file that you want to convert With MediaHuman, you can do this in one of three ways:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drop media onto the specified area</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click the “+” file option in order to manually add file</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click the “+ folder” option in order to manually add files</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select Format</strong></p>
<p>Once your file has been uploaded, select the “Format” button in the middle of the toolbar This will cause a pop-up to appear where you can choose your desired output format Of course, in our case, we chose “AIFF”</p>

<p>**<strong>1. Zamzar</strong></p>
<p>For the first <strong>AIFF Converter</strong> on this list, we have ZAMZAR ZAMZAR is an online file conversion tool that is capable of converting in a variety of file formats. Of course, the one that we’ll be looking at today is Zamzar’s <strong>AIFF Converter</strong> — which is almost 100% FREE to use (there’s a max upload file size that can only be unlocked if you pay the premium fee).</p>

<p>Our next recommended tool is Convert on Mac This is another online tool that can be used to convert a variety of files (i.e., audio, video, image, document, etc). The one that we’ll be focusing on though is Convert on Mac’s <strong>AIFF Converter</strong></p>

<p>**<strong>3. Online Converter</strong></p>
<p>The next one up is Online Converter This one is more like ZAMZAR than Convert on Mac. If only because it also comes with a max file size that is locked. It’s more limited though — in that it doesn’t support as many input and output formats. And, as you can no doubt guess from the interface, quite old-school as well.</p>

<p>For this next <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>, we make a complete departure from your general converters by introducing a completely different beast altogether Specifically, in the form of a Video Editor called Filmora. Filmora is an incredibly advanced video editing tool. And, because of this, it’s capable of most things related to video and audio editing. Including, in this case, AIFF conversion</p>

<p>**<strong>5. EaseUS Video Converter</strong></p>
<p>With ‘EaseUS Video Converter’ we continue on our trend of AIFF conversion software This one, despite its name suggesting otherwise, functions as a solid Audio Converter So far, it’s closest to Filmora Pro when compared to all the others on this list. It’s a one-trick kind of pony though. Seeing as, unlike with Filmora, you can really only use this to convert files.</p>

<p>**<strong>6. Wondershare UniConverter</strong></p>
<p>This next software, the ‘Wondershare UniConverter’ is a bit of a mix between Filmora and EaseUS Video Converter. As is evident from the UI (shown-off in the screenshot provided), it has the makings of a straightforward converter but with extra tools (i.e., video editor, video compressor, merger, screen recorder, etc.) that you can take advantage of while working on your conversions.</p>

<p>This is a hidden feature that not many people know about, but iTunes actually works as a pretty serviceable <strong>AIFF Converter</strong>. It’s not the most efficient, but with iTunes’ AIFF Encoder, conversion to AIFF is possible (converting from AIFF to MP3, and WAV is also possible because iTunes provides Encoders for those as well).</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-7"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-7" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The AIFF file format is notable because it results in higher-quality sound. This is because AIFF, unlike the more general, MP3 file format, is not a compressed format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are various ways that you can convert from and to the AIFF file format. The first method that we introduced was an online tool that would be available for use no matter what computer or device you’re using The second was chosen specifically because it was FREE and available for both Windows and Mac</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in looking through other options, the ten other converters we introduced should provide a healthy lot for you to choose from — with various levels of usefulness depending on what you need an <strong>AIFF Converter.</strong></p>

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes"><a href="#3-Timescapes" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel"><a href="#6-Sintel" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>
<h3 id="8-Honey-Bees"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p>
<h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks"><a href="#10-Fireworks" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p>
<p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-1"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-1"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes-1"><a href="#3-Timescapes-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes-1"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-1"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel-1"><a href="#6-Sintel-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample-1"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>

Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks-1"><a href="#10-Fireworks-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K.

<h4 id="1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-3"><a href="#1-Ocean-Footage-underwater-sample-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Ocean Footage underwater sample"></a>1. Ocean Footage underwater sample</h4><p>This one is first on my choice of 4K video sample for a couple of reasons, firstly I love the subject matter, and secondly from a technical perspective it is one of the best samples out there.</p>
<p>Filmed using a Red One camera, it displays the vibrancy and detail that we associate with 4K resolution at its best, the color depth of the fish and coral is astounding, and when the shot moves to a passing whale the sense of scale the resolution gives really shows what 4K is capable of, and why it is a step up from anything we have seen before.</p>
<h4 id="2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-3"><a href="#2-Trailer-for-the-movie-‘Elysium’-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’"></a>2. Trailer for the movie ‘Elysium’</h4><p>Very little movie production footage is easily available out there in 4K, but this is one of the exceptions. The full theatrical trailer for the movie in glorious Ultra HD, Why does this make the list? Well I think if you are wanting to see the benefits of 4K, then samples like the Ocean Footage one mentioned above really show off the technical prowess, but it is actual movies that most people will be wanting to use 4K kit for, and this gives you a very good indication of how much of an increase in clarity, detail and vibrancy can be gained by switching to 4K. The standard HD version of this trailer is readily available too, so this is something you could make a direct comparison with. The nature of the film, a sci-fi action film, also lends itself to 4K with lots of beautifully rendered CGI scenes in the trailer to look at.</p>
<h3 id="3-Timescapes-3"><a href="#3-Timescapes-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Timescapes"></a>3. Timescapes</h3><p>This is the trailer for an interesting project, filmed entirely in 4K and the work of one man, it is purported to be the first 4K film made available for sale. The film itself, and this trailer, is a simple concept, slow-motion and time lapse cinematography of the South West of America, taken as the director, Tom Lowe, travels around in his pickup truck. The concept itself makes for an interesting effect, but this sample is here because of the content. Watching the big expanses of nature flow by in 4K is simply mind blowing, here you really see the almost 3D effect so much resolution and detail bring to the medium, it isn’t like watching a video, it really is like looking out of a window at real life.</p>
<h3 id="4-Boat-Scenes-3"><a href="#4-Boat-Scenes-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Boat Scenes"></a>4. Boat Scenes</h3><p>There are actually several test videos on this subject, all of them do a good job of displaying 4K but for me it is the this one that focuses on passing boats against an expansive backdrop that is the one to look at. Again it shows the effect of 4K resolution when displaying the wider world around us, this time a harbor vista as the boat passes through it, detail can be seen in the water, the passengers on the boat and the backdrop, and the sense of realism and scale, which for me are the things that set 4K apart, are readily apparent here.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-3"><a href="#5-Tears-of-Steel-trailer-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Tears of Steel trailer"></a>5. Tears of Steel trailer</h3><p>Another rare 4K movie trailer, this one again shows lots of very high quality CGI that really show off the capabilities of 4K at their best. Some great use of the depth of field that 4K emphasizes in a lot of the shots and overall provides a great insight into 4K and what you can expect from it. An interesting video that also manages to tell a little story as well as being a showcase.</p>
<h3 id="6-Sintel-3"><a href="#6-Sintel-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Sintel"></a>6. Sintel</h3><p>Sintel is an animated short created in the blender animation program, here in 4K it represents a fantastic look into what 4K can offer all forms of media, the opening scene, with the snow blowing in the wind, for instance, enables you to see incredible detail that just isn’t visible within the standard HD version. Seeing individual flies as the character searches through the wreckage of a town is another high point in terms of technical prowess.</p>
<p>Another feature of Sintel is its soft focus look that accentuates the high resolution, and makes this video stand out from others in the list. The small dragon is well animated and the main characters features, particularly the hair, are incredibly well realized. A great way to showcase your 4K equipment.</p>
<h3 id="7-Stock-Footage-Sample-3"><a href="#7-Stock-Footage-Sample-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Stock Footage Sample"></a>7. Stock Footage Sample</h3><p>This one is an amalgam of short clips from commercial stock footage that is used a sample of the product. That doesn’t make it any less of a fantastic 4K clip however, with footage chosen specifically to show off the benefits of 4K at its very best (it is a promotional package after all) there is something here for everyone. From the glorious colors of a sunrise to the explosions and the amazing time lapse, with, again, fantastic and vibrant colors, a real showcase for 4K in the true sense of the word.</p>
<h3 id="8-Honey-Bees-3"><a href="#8-Honey-Bees-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Honey Bees"></a>8. Honey Bees</h3><p>Back to nature for this one, and the eponymous Honey Bee. Showing not only the color rendition and detail of the surroundings, it also captures the Bees themselves in incredible fidelity, the wing detail, especially on the close-ups, is just way beyond anything we have seen from moving images before, high resolution stills? Certainly, but not video. Another great advert for 4K footage and a lovely film as well.</p>
<h4 id="9-Skyfall-Trailer-3"><a href="#9-Skyfall-Trailer-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Skyfall Trailer"></a>9. Skyfall Trailer</h4><p>Can’t say I’m much of a fan of the films, but as a way to see what very fast action looks like in 4K this is a great one. Unlike the other movie trailers, this one isn’t full of CGI, so it shows a different aspect of 4K movies here, the real-life stunts performed by traditional stunt professionals is what this one is all about. And it doesn’t let us down, crashes, explosions and car chases, everything that Bond is about. Except in 4K. Great.</p>
<h4 id="10-Fireworks-3"><a href="#10-Fireworks-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Fireworks"></a>10. Fireworks</h4><p>This one is just a lot of fun. Fireworks, in 4K. Color rendition, detail, it has it all. It opens with a magnificent view across the city showing the lights at dusk and beyond, and then into the stunning firework display, it really is quite spectacular and a great look at 4K footage.</p>
<p>That’s our top 10, not all the best technically, but each offers something a little different to give a taste of what 4K is all about, and exactly what your 4K screen is capable of.</p>
