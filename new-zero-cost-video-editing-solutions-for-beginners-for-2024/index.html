<p><strong>What Needs to be done?</strong></p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will be asked to enter your first and last name along with your email address. Please fill in all the details. After that, click on the blue tab that says download free trial. The total size will be 2.7GB.</li>

Well, if that’s happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Poor Internet Connection</strong></p>
<p>The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won’t be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.</p>
<p><strong>Check System Requirements</strong></p>
<p>To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple’s minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won’t be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.</p>
<p><strong>Try Using Another Account</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.</p>
<p><strong>Quit and Restart your System</strong></p>
<p>If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.</p>
<p><strong>Disconnect External Devices</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?"></a>Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?</h2><p> Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that’s their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/trial-expire.jpg"
                      alt="trial-expire"
                ></p>
<p>Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4</p>
<p> #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;swift</p>
<p> import Foundation</p>
<p> let path &#x3D; URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: “~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;.ffuserdata”).expandingTildeInPath)</p>
<p> let data &#x3D; try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data</p>
<p> let dictionary &#x3D; try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary</p>
<p> let mutableDictionary &#x3D; dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary</p>
<p> for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {</p>
<p> if value is NSDate {</p>
<p> mutableDictionary[key] &#x3D; Date()</p>
<p> }</p>
<p> }</p>
<p> try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)</p>
<p> print(“You’d better buy it”)</p>
<p> It’s quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.</p>
<p>But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.</p>
<p>Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.</p>
<p>You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won’t cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.</p>

<p><strong>The Basic Requirements to Get Final Cut Pro</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OS requirement: macOS 10.15.6 or later.</li>
<li>Disc space: 3.8GB minimum. Need more room for FCPX? Click this.</li>
<li>RAM: 4GB for basic editing. But if you want to do 360o editing, it’s better to have 8GB RAM with 1GB of VRAM.</li>
<li>Graphics card: Metal-capable.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="fcpx-mac-store"
                ></p>
<p><strong>What Needs to be done?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you need to visit Apple’s Final Cut Pro page to download the 90days free trial version. Just make sure that your system meets the basic requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will be asked to enter your first and last name along with your email address. Please fill in all the details. After that, click on the blue tab that says download free trial. The total size will be 2.7GB.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let the .dmg file get downloaded. After that, you will have to double-click the installer package to start the installation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, you are all set to use the free trial of Final Cut Pro for 90 days. After the free trial ends, you will have to pay for the video editing software to continue using it.</p>
<p>There will be some limitations, though. For example, you will not be able to try the additional effects. Unfortunately, this means that even if the trial version has been extended, you will still miss out on some of the advanced features if you don’t pay.</p>
<p>For those who already try out Final Cut Pro and are happy with the editor, you can see how to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >save money with the education bundle of Apple. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-won’t-open-2"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-won’t-open-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won’t open?"></a>Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won’t open?</h2><p> Although there shouldn’t be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system’s requirements, some customers are complaining that they can’t download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that’s happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fcpx-in-mac"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Poor Internet Connection</strong></p>
<p>The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won’t be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.</p>
<p><strong>Check System Requirements</strong></p>
<p>To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple’s minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won’t be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.</p>
<p><strong>Try Using Another Account</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.</p>
<p><strong>Quit and Restart your System</strong></p>
<p>If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.</p>
<p><strong>Disconnect External Devices</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?"></a>Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?</h2><p> Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that’s their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.</p>

<p><strong>What Needs to be done?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you need to visit Apple’s Final Cut Pro page to download the 90days free trial version. Just make sure that your system meets the basic requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will be asked to enter your first and last name along with your email address. Please fill in all the details. After that, click on the blue tab that says download free trial. The total size will be 2.7GB.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let the .dmg file get downloaded. After that, you will have to double-click the installer package to start the installation process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once done, you are all set to use the free trial of Final Cut Pro for 90 days. After the free trial ends, you will have to pay for the video editing software to continue using it.</p>
<p>There will be some limitations, though. For example, you will not be able to try the additional effects. Unfortunately, this means that even if the trial version has been extended, you will still miss out on some of the advanced features if you don’t pay.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-won’t-open-3"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-won’t-open-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won’t open?"></a>Part 2: Why Final Cut Pro trial won’t open?</h2><p> Although there shouldn’t be any issue in downloading the Final Cut Pro trial version, if you meet your system’s requirements, some customers are complaining that they can’t download or install the Final Cur Pro trial package. Well, if that’s happening, there could be a few reasons which are highlighted below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fcpx-in-mac"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Poor Internet Connection</strong></p>
<p>The most common reason for not being able to download Final Cut Pro 90 days trial version is you have a poor internet connection. You may feel that you have a superb browsing speed, but if your downloading speed is slow, the file may encounter some glitches, eventually ending up with a broken Final Cut Pro Trial file. And once the package is broken, you won’t be able to install the installer package. Also, the downloading file is quite huge, and you need to have a proper internet connection. So, before contacting Apple to check whether your internet connection is strong or not.</p>
<p><strong>Check System Requirements</strong></p>
<p>To download the Final Cut Pro free trial version, your Mac system has to meet Apple’s minimum requirements. Even if one of the requirements fails to meet, you won’t be able to download Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial. To try the latest version, the OS has to be 10.15.6 or later. Your system must have 4GB of RAM and a metal-capable graphics card. The disk space should be 3.8GB. Ensure that your system meets the requirement. If the OS is not updated, update it before trying to download the package.</p>
<p><strong>Try Using Another Account</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro 90-days free trial is essentially available for new users or those already using the 30days free trial. For those who are already on the 30-days free trial, the free trial package will automatically get extended. But Final Cut Pro already has your account details. Hence, if your previous free trial expired already, you may face some issues when trying to download, launch, or run the latest 90-days free trial offer. So, you can use another account and sign up and then try to download the newest version.</p>
<p><strong>Quit and Restart your System</strong></p>
<p>If you have successfully downloaded and installed Final Cut Pro but are unable to launch Final Cut Pro even after refreshing memory, probably, there is a minor glitch on your system. The primary thing to do would be trying to restart your system and then check if you are able to launch it now.</p>
<p><strong>Disconnect External Devices</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a malfunctioning or incompatible external device, even then, you may face problems while running Final Cut Pro. To resolve this issue, first shut down your system. Now, apart from the mouse and keyboard, disconnect every other external device that you are using. Next, reset NVRAM and now try to launch Final Cut Pro; it should operate normally now.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-reset-the-Final-Cut-Pro-trial-before-it-expires-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?"></a>Part 3: How to reset the Final Cut Pro trial before it expires?</h2><p> Final Cut Pro free trial version will be over after 90 days because that’s their policy. Unfortunately, this means that once the free trial version is over, you will have to buy Final Cut Pro to continue using it. However, there is a way to reset it. But first, you need to check if your Mac has swift library installed. If it is installed and running, go on and enter the code mentioned below in the terminal and then hit enter. After everything is done, the code will be executed, and the rest of the free trial version will be completed.</p>

                      alt="trial-expire"
                ></p>
<p>Code to reset Final Cut Pro 10.4.4</p>
<p> #!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;swift</p>
<p> import Foundation</p>
<p> let path &#x3D; URL(fileURLWithPath: NSString(string: “~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;.ffuserdata”).expandingTildeInPath)</p>
<p> let data &#x3D; try! NSData(contentsOf: path) as Data</p>
<p> let dictionary &#x3D; try! NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as! NSDictionary</p>
<p> let mutableDictionary &#x3D; dictionary.mutableCopy() as! NSMutableDictionary</p>
<p> for (key, value) in mutableDictionary {</p>
<p> if value is NSDate {</p>
<p> mutableDictionary[key] &#x3D; Date()</p>
<p> }</p>
<p> }</p>
<p> try! NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: mutableDictionary, requiringSecureCoding: false).write(to: path)</p>
<p> print(“You’d better buy it”)</p>
<p> It’s quite complicated that you will have to enter this code manually into the terminal each time the trial expires. Regrettably, there is no way to extend the free trial permanently, so you will have to repeat this part over and over again.</p>
<p>But to be aware, this may lead to a ban or other punishment to your account by Apple Inc.</p>
<p>Anyway, it makes sense why people want to stick to their free trial! Final Cut Pro is not an affordable video editing tool.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro Additional Content, which includes over 1300 royalty-free sound effects for use in your projects, isn’t available in the Final Cut Pro trial. The trial is fully functional otherwise.</p>
<p>You can import media, edit, organize, add effects, color correct, export files in a variety of professional formats, and more. Get an overview of Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Is Final Cut Pro worth the price?</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro comes with robust video editing features, which can help you create stunning and professional-level videos. However, Final Cut Pro is not for beginners, and if $299 is a little too expensive for you, it is better to find another video editing tool that won’t cost you this much and will let you create professional-looking videos effortlessly. This is when Filmora by Wondershare comes into play.</p>

<h5 id="Liza-Brown-4"><a href="#Liza-Brown-4" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/pro-apps.png"
                      alt="pro-apps"
                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>
<p>For beginners who don’t actually need those many apps can always go with a <strong>cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora</strong>. Click and have a try!</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>

<p>There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.</p>
<p>The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >90-day free trial of FCPX. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-in-Apple’s-Pro-Apps-Bundle-for-Education-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is in Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education?</strong></h2><p>The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.</p>
<p>Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There’s no time limit to ownership, and it doesn’t ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you’re thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99. Motion and Compressor aren’t sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>So, exactly how much are you saving here?</strong></p>
<p>If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you’ll be saving $100. You’ll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you’ll be saving <strong>$330</strong>—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don’t anyone offers that kind of deal.</p>
<p>If you’re a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that’s your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.</p>
<p>For beginners who don’t actually need those many apps can always go with a <strong>cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora</strong>. Click and have a try!</p>
