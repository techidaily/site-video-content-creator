<h2 id="How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?"></a>How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be really exciting to use if you also get to know the solutions to reset the video editing tool. There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences"><a href="#Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Locating the Preferences"></a>Method 1: Locating the Preferences</h3><p>You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.</p>
<p>The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files"><a href="#Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Deleting Render Files"></a>Method 2: Deleting Render Files</h3><p>Do remember to save your important files before you do this. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.</p>
<p>You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder"><a href="#Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder"></a>Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder</h3><p>This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Word"><a href="#Final-Word" class="headerlink" title="Final Word"></a>Final Word</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3"><a href="#How-to-Reset-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?"></a>How to Reset Final Cut Pro X?</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be really exciting to use if you also get to know the solutions to reset the video editing tool. There can be several reasons as listed above due to which you may require resetting the tool. Here are a few common methods that can fix the problems and reset the software tool as a whole. We have explained the methods with the help of screenshots for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences-3"><a href="#Method-1-Locating-the-Preferences-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Locating the Preferences"></a>Method 1: Locating the Preferences</h3><p>You will require locating the preferences when the Final Cut Pro X keeps crashing. Usually, this program has five different locations where it stores preferences and settings, and that’s from where you can delete the right ones. Located in the library folder, you will find a sub-category of the root level library preferences folder containing the Final Cut Pro System Support folder.</p>
<p>The custom settings folder will contain the presets which you will have to delete. As soon as you find the right folder, you can begin trashing. You can drag the folders to the Trash and empty them then re-open the Final Cut Pro X to see if the problem is settled. If it isn’t, try deleting some more and keep checking the software tool.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files-3"><a href="#Method-2-Deleting-Render-Files-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Deleting Render Files"></a>Method 2: Deleting Render Files</h3><p>Do remember to save your important files before you do this. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Click here to see How to Save Final Cut Pro Project the Right Way？ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>This can come in handy when your timeline does not share or render, or simply crash during playback of the rendered area. These render files in Final Cut Pro X seem to be particularly vulnerable to corruption. If you face any troubles during export or rendering, you should instead delete them in the first place. It should be your first action. In order to successfully do so, you can select the project in the browser and choose the file. After that, you can delete the generated project files.</p>
<p>You can begin deleting the files with just a few unused items, but if you feel that you face more trouble you can delete all the files instead. However, you will not have to delete optimized media or proxy. If the problem remains, you can delete the generated files from the Library or the event.</p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder-3"><a href="#Method-3-Transferring-Events-to-a-Fresh-Library-Folder-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder"></a>Method 3: Transferring Events to a Fresh Library Folder</h3><p>This method can be useful if the library corrupts. You should consider transferring your events to a freshly created Library. The majority of the time, this would resolve the problem. If you cannot open the Library, you can eliminate some specific generated items under the Library bundle’s root level. Ideally removing “Setting.plist” and “CurrentVersion.flexolibrary” are the safe options for removal, which can likely open the Library.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Word-3"><a href="#Final-Word-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Word"></a>Final Word</h2><p>Final Cut Pro X can be a very helpful video editing tool until it acts up. Regardless of the reasons for a crashing program, you should consider implementing any of the aforementioned methods to reset the editor, troubleshoot the problems, and seamlessly edit your videos in the long run.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>
<h2 id="Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion"><a href="#Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Final Cut Pro X Price</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

<p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p>
<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-1"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p>
<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>

Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>

<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p>
<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>This online portal enables you to create virtual faces by specifying the physical attributes of a character, such as gender, age, hair color, eye color, and much more.

<p>This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.</p>

<p>Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:</p>

<h3 id="4-Massless"><a href="#4-Massless" class="headerlink" title="4. Massless"></a>4.

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.</p>
<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Download images</strong> from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;</li>
<li>Click <strong>Another</strong> from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save image</strong> from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Different browsers may have this feature with other names</p>

<p>This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click <strong>Generate Another Fake Human</strong> if you don’t like the one that appears;</li>
<li>Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Generate A Human</strong> button to create a less realistic image of a random person.</li>

<p>faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.</p>
<p>You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click <strong>Start</strong> from the main page.</li>
<li>Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Continue</strong> on the next page.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing.

<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>

<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p>This online portal enables you to create virtual faces by specifying the physical attributes of a character, such as gender, age, hair color, eye color, and much more. You can be as creative as you want to generate a face that appears somewhat like you with the available options. Once a look is generated, you can download and use it as needed.</p>
<p>The steps that are given below explain how you can use Generated Photos’ Faces section to create and download a virtual face:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your favorite web browser and go to the URL given above, and then you will see all free AI-generated photos on this website.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the filters given in the left pane to define your character’s physical attributes and click <strong>Apply</strong> from the bottom to get the results. You can customize the face from its head post, gender, age, hair, eye, and emotion aspects.</li>
<li>Click your preferred character from the AI-generated faces, and then click <strong>Download</strong> from the page that opens next. Choose your preferred method to sign up, and then sign in to download the virtual face to your PC.</li>

<p>Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click <strong>Upload photo;</strong></li>
<li>Select and upload your photo from your PC to the portal and wait while Anonymizer uses AI to generate similar faces.</li>
<li>Click the photo that you want to use, and when the next page opens up, click Sign up or sign in to download the photo and use it wherever needed</li>

<p>This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.</p>

<p>Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:</p>

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.</p>
<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Download images</strong> from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;</li>
<li>Click <strong>Another</strong> from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save image</strong> from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Different browsers may have this feature with other names</p>

<p>This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click.

<p>You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click <strong>Generate Another Fake Human</strong> if you don’t like the one that appears;</li>
<li>Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Generate A Human</strong> button to create a less realistic image of a random person.</li>

<p>faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.</p>
<p>You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:</p>
