What’s more, your device needs ARMv7 in order to run this app, which means that you won’t be able to use it on older models of Android phones.</p>

Media Converter – Video to MP3 supports a broad range of input file formats and it lets you convert them to MP3, M4A, WAV, and other audio file formats. This app lacks more advanced MP4 to MP3 file conversion options since you can’t select the preferred bitrate of the output files or add tags to them. The app contains ads, and you must make an in-app purchase in order to remove them. Even the Pro version of the Media Converter – Video to MP3 doesn’t offer the file-sharing options.</p>

<p>Deciding which option to go for when you have two high-performance video editing software like LumaFusion and Final Cut Pro X can be a tough choice to make.</p>
<p>LumaFusion was originally a hands-on video editing app on iOS, adapted to iPad and iPhone alone. At the same time, Final Cut Pro X was designed to run on Mac.</p>
<p>With the recent compatibility of LumaFusion on the M1 MacBook Air, which surfaced in 2020, there have been recent concerns from expert users that very soon, these iOS Pro editing giants may lock horns in no time; if the latter sees more advanced upgrades.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

<p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

                ></p>

<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

<p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

<p>Since LumaFusion is less complex because of its user interface flexibility, most users who do not see a need for advanced video manipulation features tend to use it. All you need to do is drag and drop, and in a few minutes, you will be through with your editing process.</p>
<p>However, since Final Cut Pro X adopts highly advanced features and effects, it is best for Pro users who want to edit projects which need major manipulation and complex editing. We still have to keep our fingers crossed for subsequent LumaFusion upgrades since it recently welcomed compatibility on Mac.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, if you need an editing process with all the professional features and high manipulation toolsets, then Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you.</p>
<h2 id="Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#Price-comparison-between-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Price comparison between Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Final Cut Pro X Price</strong></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a free 90-day trial option on the recent version, and of course, it is only available exclusively on Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Within the trial period, you would not have access to the 1000+ royalty-free sound effects in the premium version. Still, you can use other unique features for editing, like color correction, adding effects, organizing, editing, and importing and exporting files in different formats.</p>

<p>During the 90-free trial, you can purchase your Final Cut Pro X, which comes with the Logic Pro built-in for $299, or try the Pro Apps Bundle for Education which has the Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro, Compressor, MainStage, and Motion pre-installed for just $199, which gives you a direct and automatic update on purchase. Final Cut Pro comes with a 6 years license span.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion Price</strong></p>
<p>Compared to other video editing apps in the same category as LumaFision, it has a very flexible pricing system. And since users prefer something with creativity and have a simple interface, it is evident while many new users choose to enjoy the fluid system it portends.</p>
<p>For a fantastic software like this, offering multiple editing with professional and highly detailed effects, audio, and color, a one-off payment as low as $29.99 is just so perfect.</p>

<p>Many features endeared Final Cut Pro versions to expert users, but more precise advance features like trackless Magnetic Timeline view and great tools for splitting and trimming videos made it more impressive. You can edit, split or trim your videos with a few clicks of your mouse and easily undo any move if you prefer to leave previous options.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X comes with a highly efficient tool known as the Compound Clips. This feature helps you group your clips, effects, and audio in a single space, so they become a perfectly synchronized piece.</p>
<p>Also, it comes with the Roles feature, which helps explain a particular clip, ranging from videos to titles, dialog, effect, etc. It is a great organizing tool, which enables you to identify what kind of track you are playing.</p>
<p><strong>LumaFusion</strong></p>
<p>LumaFusion is well-known for its portability and easy-to-use interface, which is why I recommend it for beginners. However, LumaFusion is in many ways like a professional video editing tool, with editing interface features like preview monitor, search panel, source clip which helps you identify your timeline edit on the fascinating multitrack timeline.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Though many users prefer it to other mobile-based editing apps, others think it is best to introduce it fully on the Mac version because the buttons look a lot more complex for an App. Also, stating that the use of the preview screen is almost irrelevant since it isn’t big due to the mobile display screen.</p>
<p>However, with a simple drag and drop feature, it is easy to fall in love with this tool, as the interface doesn’t look as complex as some make it seem.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#Summary-for-Final-Cut-Pro-X-Vs-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion"></a><strong>Summary for Final Cut Pro X Vs LumaFusion</strong></h2><p><strong>Is LumaFusion worth it?</strong></p>
<p>It is no story that the LumaFusion Team has tried their best in developing an amazing piece like this. And with the pace at which it is welcoming many advanced features, it could turn out to be one of the most used editing software on iOS. Sadly, you cannot run LumaFusion on Android or Windows now, but hopefully, subsequent upgrades and adjustments could introduce other device and OS compatibility.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are looking for a low-budget app to work on a minor project with less stress and more productivity, then LumaFusion is the best option for you. You will most likely cut down the stress of carrying a larger screen and clicking on your mouse at intervals by 70%.</p>
<p>Also, with a one-time payment of just $29, you can just save your two days lunch money to enjoy your editing process forever! I’m just saying that you don’t have to break a bank to get one.</p>
<p>However, if you are looking for a software or editing tool to handle a huge project with advanced effects, this option isn’t just what you should try out.</p>
<p> <strong>Why should you try Final Cut Pro X?</strong></p>
<p>High definition editing options, professional audio effects, and at least 1300 royalty-free sound effects are some reasons Pro editors will always run to Final Cut. Though all software has setbacks, Final Cut Pro X has proven efficient as an advanced tool for professionals who want to deliver their best. It has more intricate features which provide more detailed effects and manipulations in simple click and drag patterns.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for software to handle bulk editing projects, Final Cut Pro X is the best option for you, as against the latter. Even though it costs a whopping $199 for the Pro Bundle option, it is well worth it.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro X in every ramification is more suitable to Pro users because their designers focused on making it ideal for complex projects, which is why many professional editors prefer it. But the highly flexible and fluid user interface of LumaFusion has recently endeared it to many.</p>
<p>Quite evidently, either of them serves the same purpose and at a very proficient level, but your choice strictly depends on what you want to use them for. So first, consider that factor before setting out to buy any of them.</p>

We’ll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try"></a>Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try</h2><p>In today’s world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone’s life.

Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.</p>
<p><em>Check how to use</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>QuickTime</em> <em>Player to Record Desktop Screen and Audio</em></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>
<h3 id="3-Clips"><a href="#3-Clips" class="headerlink" title="3. Clips"></a>3. Clips</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to Use</p>
<p>You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don’t sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you’d see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Clips?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you’re an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family-Oriented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn’t even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with iMovie?</strong></p>
<p>iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X’s younger sibling. But it’s free with your Mac, so there’s no danger in giving it a shot. It’s an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although iMovie is rather simple, this may be considered a benefit for inexperienced editors. You can combine, cut, and rearrange your original video and audio with iMovie.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4K Video Editing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you’ve done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In September, iMovie received a major upgrade, which included importing and editing footage taken in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 to Macs. You may now add, tweak, and delete focus points, as well as change the depths of field effect in a video shot in Cinematic mode, assuming you have a modern iPhone or iPad.</p>

There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> conversion the other for the more specified <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> conversion!</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MP4"><a href="#01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MP4" class="headerlink" title="01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?"></a>01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?</h3><p><strong>Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)</strong></p>
<p>For our example, we’ll be using the <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!</p>
<p>To start using your chosen <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it’s as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)</p>

                      alt="Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.</p>
<p>(For our example <strong>MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose MP4 Output Format"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Start Converting!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen your desired output format (which in this case is <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong>), select the “CONVERT” button to finish up!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your chosen <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.</p>
<p>In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the “Finished” tab and select “OPEN” to go directly to the file location.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="02How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MOV"><a href="#02How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MOV" class="headerlink" title="02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?"></a>02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?</h3><p>We’ve also included how you can convert <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!</strong></p>
<p>First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> converter.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png"
                      alt="Choose Files for Upload"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘MOV’ Format!</strong></p>
<p>This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the “MOV” format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select MOV output format"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Convert!</strong></p>
<p>Again, just like before, select “CONVERT” to start the conversion process from <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select Conver or Convert All"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!</strong></p>
<p>Then, finally, go to the “Finished” tab to find your new MOV file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> instead — that’s possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert <strong>MP4 to MP3</strong>, that works too!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.</p>

There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> conversion the other for the more specified <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> conversion!</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MP4-2"><a href="#01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-MP4-2" class="headerlink" title="01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?"></a>01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?</h3><p><strong>Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)</strong></p>
<p>For our example, we’ll be using the <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!</p>
<p>To start using your chosen <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it’s as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.</p>
<p>(For our example <strong>MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose MP4 Output Format"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Start Converting!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen your desired output format (which in this case is <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong>), select the “CONVERT” button to finish up!</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4</strong></p>
<p>Depending on your chosen <strong>free MP3 to MP4 converter</strong>, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.</p>
<p>In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the “Finished” tab and select “OPEN” to go directly to the file location.</p>
<p><img

As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!</strong></p>
<p>First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> converter.)</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Choose Files for Upload"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘MOV’ Format!</strong></p>
<p>This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the “MOV” format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Select MOV output format"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Convert!</strong></p>
<p>Again, just like before, select “CONVERT” to start the conversion process from <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong>!</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!</strong></p>
<p>Then, finally, go to the “Finished” tab to find your new MOV file.</p>

Well, if that’s the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!</p>
<h3 id="02Zamzar-2"><a href="#02Zamzar-2" class="headerlink" title="02Zamzar"></a>02Zamzar</h3><p>Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn’t just convert <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> or <strong>MP3 into MOV</strong> — it also does the job if you’re looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.</p>
<h3 id="03Online-File-Converter-2"><a href="#03Online-File-Converter-2" class="headerlink" title="03Online File Converter"></a>03Online File Converter</h3><p>Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.</p>
<h3 id="04Any-Conv-2"><a href="#04Any-Conv-2" class="headerlink" title="04Any Conv"></a>04Any Conv</h3><p>AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you’re looking for an online solution, but you don’t like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="05Uniconverter-2"><a href="#05Uniconverter-2" class="headerlink" title="05Uniconverter"></a>05Uniconverter</h3><p>Uniconverter is an online <strong>MP3 to MP4</strong> tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It’s a very solid tool. And it’s quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.</p>
<h3 id="06MConverter-Chrome-Extension-2"><a href="#06MConverter-Chrome-Extension-2" class="headerlink" title="06MConverter - Chrome Extension"></a>06MConverter - Chrome Extension</h3><p>Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we’re delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!</p>

All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.</p>
<h3 id="04Any-Conv-3"><a href="#04Any-Conv-3" class="headerlink" title="04Any Conv"></a>04Any Conv</h3><p>AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you’re looking for an online solution, but you don’t like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="05Uniconverter-3"><a href="#05Uniconverter-3" class="headerlink" title="05Uniconverter"></a>05Uniconverter</h3><p>Uniconverter is an online <strong>MP3 to MP4</strong> tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It’s a very solid tool. And it’s quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.</p>
<h3 id="06MConverter-Chrome-Extension-3"><a href="#06MConverter-Chrome-Extension-3" class="headerlink" title="06MConverter - Chrome Extension"></a>06MConverter - Chrome Extension</h3><p>Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we’re delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Despite the variety of options out there for <strong>MP3 into MP4</strong> converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your <strong>MP3 to MOV</strong> instead — that’s possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert <strong>MP4 to MP3</strong>, that works too!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.</p>
