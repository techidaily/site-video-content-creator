<p>Maximizing the conversion rates is the ultimate goal of every web marketing professional. The statistics clearly indicate that video content boosts conversion rates, more than any other type of online content, which is the reason why a growing number of marketers choose to incorporate video into their social media marketing strategies. Whiteboard animations have been around since the early days of animation, but their spike in popularity coincides with the rise of digital marketing in the mid-2000s. A little over a decade later, whiteboard animations are used for a wide array of purposes that range from explainer to educational videos. We’ve combed the Internet to find the best whiteboard animation makers in 2020, so let’s dive in and see what these software products and web-based platforms have to offer.</p>
<p>In fact, if you are already a Filmora user, you can try making whiteboard animation with Filmora, which gives you 100% freedom of what you want to make.</p>

<p>Formerly known as GoAnimate, Vyond has been one of the best cloud-based video animation platforms for more than a decade. Its Whiteboard Animation theme offers a huge selection of props, character actions and other animated elements that can be useful for videos that cover a broad spectrum of topics. Simply select an element you want to add to your video, fine-tune its size on the screen and it will be drawn automatically. Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p>
<p>Formerly known as GoAnimate, Vyond has been one of the best cloud-based video animation platforms for more than a decade. Its Whiteboard Animation theme offers a huge selection of props, character actions and other animated elements that can be useful for videos that cover a broad spectrum of topics. Simply select an element you want to add to your video, fine-tune its size on the screen and it will be drawn automatically. Vyond also enables you to import assets you’ve created which grants you more creative freedom, as you don’t necessarily have to rely solely on the built-in whiteboard animation elements this platform offers. The only downside is that you can’t record voiceovers directly from Vyond, and you either have to use an online voice recording service or utilize a desktop-based software product that enables you to record the narration for your upcoming animated video.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>

                      alt="file manager app show hidden files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.</p>

                      alt="file manager whatsapp files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 4: Look for the WhatsApp folder, go to ‘Media’ and then click on the folder ‘.Statuses’</p>

                      alt="file manager whatsapp statuses"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: First, download the app <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en_US&gl=US" >‘Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.’ And open the app and grant it storage access.</p>
<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.</p>

Contacts can see your current location and if you are online at any given time.</p>
<p>Sending free messages to contacts all over the world is made possible through the usage of WiFi or a network connection using WhatsApp. In WhatsApp, you may set a status, which informs your relatives and friends about your whereabouts and whether or not you are online so that they can view the messages.</p>
<p>WhatsApp Status is a status update that is only visible for 24 hours after it is uploaded. You can send pictures, videos, text, links, and animated GIFs to other people. Knowing how to use Instagram Stories will make you feel right at home in no time at all. WhatsApp Status is activated only between two people, who have each other’s contact information saved in their address books; this happens by default.

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
